From the other room, Gabe yelled, “Hey, Sally—how about some bean
dip, huh?”
I gritted my teeth.
My mom is the nicest lady in the world.
She should’ve been married to a
millionaire, not to some jerk like Gabe.
For her sake, I tried to sound upbeat about my last days at Yancy
Academy.
I told her I wasn’t too down about the expulsion.
I’d lasted almost
the whole year this time.
I’d made some new friends.
I’d done pretty well in
Latin.
And honestly, the fights hadn’t been as bad as the headmaster said.
I
liked Yancy Academy.
I really did.
I put such a good spin on the year, I
almost convinced myself.
Gabe appeared in the doorway and growled, “Bean dip, Sally?
Didn’t you
hear me?”
I wanted to punch him, but I met my mom’s eyes
and I understood she
was offering me a deal: be nice to Gabe for a little while.
Just until she was
ready to leave for Montauk.
Then we would get out of here.
“I was on my way, honey,” she told Gabe.
“We were just talking about
the trip.”
Gabe’s eyes got small.
“The trip?
You mean you were serious about
that?”
“I knew it,” I muttered.
“He won’t let us go.”
“Of course he will,” my mom said evenly.
“Your stepfather is just
worried about money.
That’s all.
Besides,” she added, “Gabriel won’t have to
settle for bean dip.
I’ll make him enough seven-layer dip for the whole
weekend.
Guacamole.
Sour cream.
The works.”
Gabe softened a bit.
“So this money for your trip…it comes out of your
clothes budget, right?”
“Yes, honey,” my mother said.
“And you won’t take my car anywhere but there and back.”
“We’ll be very careful.”
Gabe scratched his double chin.
“Maybe if you hurry with that sevenlayer dip…And maybe if the kid apologizes for interrupting my poker game.”
Maybe if I kick you in your soft spot, I thought.
And make you sing
soprano for a week.
But my mom’s eyes warned me not to make him mad.
Why did she put up with this guy?
I wanted to scream.
Why did she care
what he thought?
“I’m sorry,” I muttered.
“I’m really sorry I interrupted your incredibly
important poker game.
Please go back to it right now.”
Gabe’s eyes narrowed.
His tiny brain was probably trying to detect
sarcasm in my statement.
“Yeah, whatever,” he decided.
He went back to his game.
“Thank you, Percy,” my mom said.
“Once we get to Montauk, we’ll talk
more about…whatever you’ve forgotten to tell me, okay?”
For a moment, I thought I saw anxiety in her eyes—the same fear I’d seen
in Grover during the bus ride—as if my mom too felt an odd chill in the air.
But then her smile returned, and I figured I must have been mistaken.
She
ruffled my hair and went to make Gabe his seven-layer dip.
An hour later we were ready to leave.
Gabe took a break from his poker game long enough to watch me lug my
mom’s bags to the car.
He kept griping and groaning about losing her
cooking—and more important, his ’78 Camaro—for the whole weekend.
“Not a scratch on this car, brain boy,” he warned me as I loaded the last
bag.
“Not one little scratch.”
Like I’d be the one driving.
I was twelve.
But that didn’t matter to Gabe.
If a seagull so much as pooped on his paint job, he’d find a way to blame me.
Watching him lumber back toward the apartment building, I got so mad I
did something I can’t explain.
As Gabe reached the doorway, I made the hand
gesture I’d seen Grover make on the bus, a sort of warding-off-evil gesture, a
clawed hand over my heart, then a shoving movement toward Gabe.
The
screen door slammed shut so hard it whacked him in the butt and sent him
flying up the staircase as if he’d been shot from a cannon.
Maybe it was just
the wind, or some freak accident with the hinges, but I didn’t stay long
enough to find out.
I got in the Camaro and told my mom to step on it.
Our rental cabin was on the south shore, way out at the tip of Long Island.
It
was a little pastel box with faded curtains, half sunken into the dunes.
There
was always sand in the sheets and spiders in the cabinets, and most of the
time the sea was too cold to swim in.
I loved the place.
We’d been going there since I was a baby.
My mom had been going even
longer.
She never exactly said, but I knew why the beach was special to her.
It was the place where she’d met my dad.
As we got closer to Montauk, she seemed to grow younger, years of
worry and work disappearing from her face.
Her eyes turned the color of the
sea.
We got there at sunset, opened all the cabin’s windows, and went through
our usual cleaning routine.
We walked on the beach, fed blue corn chips to
the seagulls, and munched on blue jelly beans, blue saltwater taffy, and all
the other free samples my mom had brought from work.
I guess I should explain the blue food.
See, Gabe had once told my mom there was no such thing.
They had this
fight, which seemed like a really small thing at the time.
But ever since, my
mom went out of her way to eat blue.
She baked blue birthday cakes.
She
mixed blueberry smoothies.
She bought blue-corn tortilla chips and brought
home blue candy from the shop.
This—along with keeping her maiden name,
Jackson, rather than calling herself Mrs. Ugliano—was proof that she wasn’t
totally suckered by Gabe.
She did have a rebellious streak, like me.
When it got dark, we made a fire.
We roasted hot dogs and
marshmallows.
Mom told me stories about when she was a kid, back before
her parents died in the plane crash.
She told me about the books she wanted
to write someday, when she had enough money to quit the candy shop.
Eventually, I got up the nerve to ask about what was always on my mind
whenever we came to Montauk—my father.
Mom’s eyes went all misty.
I
figured she would tell me the same things she always did, but I never got
tired of hearing them.
“He was kind, Percy,” she said.
“Tall, handsome, and powerful.
But
gentle, too.
You have his black hair, you know, and his green eyes.”
Mom fished a blue jelly bean out of her candy bag.
“I wish he could see
you, Percy.
He would be so proud.”
I wondered how she could say that.
What was so great about me?
A
dyslexic, hyperactive boy with a D+ report card, kicked out of school for the
sixth time in six years.
“How old was I?”
I asked.
“I mean…when he left?”
She watched the flames.
“He was only with me for one summer, Percy.
Right here at this beach.
This cabin.”
“But…he knew me as a baby.”

“No, honey.
He knew I was expecting a baby, but he never saw you.
He
had to leave before you were born.”
I tried to square that with the fact that I seemed to remember…something
about my father.
A warm glow.
A smile.
I had always assumed he knew me as a baby.
My mom had never said it
outright, but still, I’d felt it must be true.
Now, to be told that he’d never even
seen me…
I felt angry at my father.
Maybe it was stupid, but I resented him for
going on that ocean voyage, for not having the guts to marry my mom.
He’d
left us, and now we were stuck with Smelly Gabe.
“Are you going to send me away again?”
I asked her.
“To another
boarding school?”
She pulled a marshmallow from the fire.
“I don’t know, honey.”
Her voice was heavy.
“I think…I think we’ll have
to do something.”
“Because you don’t want me around?”
I regretted the words as soon as
they were out.
My mom’s eyes welled with tears.
She took my hand, squeezed it tight.
“Oh, Percy, no.
I—I have to, honey.
For your own good.
I have to send you
away.”
Her words reminded me of what Mr. Brunner had said—that it was best
for me to leave Yancy.
“Because I’m not normal,” I said.
“You say that as if it’s a bad thing, Percy.
But you don’t realize how
important you are.
I thought Yancy Academy would be far enough away.
I
thought you’d finally be safe.”
“Safe from what?”
She met my eyes, and a flood of memories came back to me—all the
weird, scary things that had ever happened to me, some of which I’d tried to
forget.
During third grade, a man in a black trench coat had stalked me on the
playground.
When the teachers threatened to call the police, he went away
growling, but no one believed me when I told them that under his broadbrimmed hat, the man only had one eye, right in the middle of his head.
Before that—a really early memory.
I was in preschool, and a teacher
accidentally put me down for a nap in a cot that a snake had slithered into.
My mom screamed when she came to pick me up and found me playing with
a limp, scaly rope I’d somehow managed to strangle to death with my meaty
toddler hands.
In every single school, something creepy had happened, something
unsafe, and I was forced to move.
I knew I should tell my mom about the old ladies at the fruit stand, and
Mrs. Dodds at the art museum, about my weird hallucination that I had sliced
my math teacher into dust with a sword.
But I couldn’t make myself tell her.
I
had a strange feeling the news would end our trip to Montauk, and I didn’t
want that.
“I’ve tried to keep you as close to me as I could,” my mom said.
“They
told me that was a mistake.
But there’s only one other option, Percy—the
place your father wanted to send you.
And I just…I just can’t stand to do it.”
“My father wanted me to go to a special school?”
“Not a school,” she said softly.
“A summer camp.”
My head was spinning.
Why would my dad—who hadn’t even stayed
around long enough to see me born—talk to my mom about a summer camp?
And if it was so important, why hadn’t she ever mentioned it before?
“I’m sorry, Percy,” she said, seeing the look in my eyes.
“But I can’t talk
about it.
I—I couldn’t send you to that place.
It might mean saying good-bye
to you for good.”
“For good?
But if it’s only a summer camp…”
She turned toward the fire, and I knew from her expression that if I asked
her any more questions she would start to cry.
That night I had a vivid dream.
It was storming on the beach, and two
beautiful animals, a white horse and a golden eagle, were trying to kill each
other at the edge of the surf.
The eagle swooped down and slashed the horse’s
muzzle with its huge talons.
The horse reared up and kicked at the eagle’s
wings.
As they fought, the ground rumbled, and a monstrous voice chuckled
somewhere beneath the earth, goading the animals to fight harder.
I ran toward them, knowing I had to stop them from killing each other,
but I was running in slow motion.
I knew I would be too late.
I saw the eagle
dive down, its beak aimed at the horse’s wide eyes, and I screamed, No!
I woke with a start.
Outside, it really was storming, the kind of storm that cracks trees and
blows down houses.
There was no horse or eagle on the beach, just lightning
making false daylight, and twenty-foot waves pounding the dunes like
artillery.
With the next thunderclap, my mom woke.
She sat up, eyes wide, and
said, “Hurricane.”
I knew that was crazy.
Long Island never sees hurricanes this early in the
summer.
But the ocean seemed to have forgotten.
Over the roar of the wind, I
heard a distant bellow, an angry, tortured sound that made my hair stand on

end.
Then a much closer noise, like mallets in the sand.
A desperate voice—
someone yelling, pounding on our cabin door.
My mother sprang out of bed in her nightgown and threw open the lock.
Grover stood framed in the doorway against a backdrop of pouring rain.
But he wasn’t…he wasn’t exactly Grover.
“Searching all night,” he gasped.
“What were you thinking?”
My mother looked at me in terror—not scared of Grover, but of why he’d
come.
“Percy,” she said, shouting to be heard over the rain.
“What happened at
school?
What didn’t you tell me?”
I was frozen, looking at Grover.
I couldn’t understand what I was seeing.
“O Zeu kai alloi theoi!”
he yelled.
“It’s right behind me!
Didn’t you tell
her?”
I was too shocked to register that he’d just cursed in Ancient Greek, and
I’d understood him perfectly.
Sally.
Sally Jackson.
I
had to find her.
I had to stop Hades from causing World War III.
I found Annabeth still building her city.
“Come on,” I told her.
“We’ve got to get out of here.”
No response.
I shook her.
“Annabeth?”
She looked up, annoyed.
“What?”

“We need to leave.”
“Leave?
What are you talking about?
I’ve just got the towers—”
“This place is a trap.”
She didn’t respond until I shook her again.
“What?”
“Listen.
The Underworld.
Our quest!”
“Oh, come on, Percy.
Just a few more minutes.”
“Annabeth, there are people here from 1977.
Kids who have never aged.
You check in, and you stay forever.”
“So?” she asked.
“Can you imagine a better place?”
I grabbed her wrist and yanked her away from the game.
“Hey!”
She screamed and hit me, but nobody else even bothered looking
at us.
They were too busy.
I made her look directly in my eyes.
I said, “Spiders.
Large, hairy
spiders.”
That jarred her.
Her vision cleared.
“Oh my gods,” she said.
“How long
have we—”
“I don’t know, but we’ve got to find Grover.”
We went searching, and found him still playing Virtual Deer Hunter.
“Grover!”
we both shouted.
He said, “Die, human!
Die, silly polluting nasty person!”
“Grover!”
He turned the plastic gun on me and started clicking, as if I were just
another image from the screen.
“Hey, Sally!
That meat loaf done yet or what?”
She closed her eyes.
“He isn’t going to be happy to see you, Percy.
The
store got half a million phone calls today from Los Angeles…something
about free appliances.”
“Oh, yeah.
About that…”
She managed a weak smile.
“Just don’t make him angrier, all right?
Come on.”
In the month I’d been gone, the apartment had turned into Gabeland.
Garbage was ankle deep on the carpet.
The sofa had been reupholstered in
beer cans.
Dirty socks and underwear hung off the lampshades.
Gabe and three of his big goony friends were playing poker at the table.
When Gabe saw me, his cigar dropped out of his mouth.
His face got
redder than lava.
“You got nerve coming here, you little punk.
I thought the
police—”
“He’s not a fugitive after all,” my mom interjected.
“Isn’t that wonderful,
Gabe?”
Gabe looked back and forth between us.
He didn’t seem to think my
homecoming was so wonderful.
“Bad enough I had to give back your life insurance money, Sally,” he
growled.
“Get me the phone.
I’ll call the cops.”
“Gabe, no!”
He raised his eyebrows.
“Did you just say ‘no’ ?
You think I’m gonna put
up with this punk again?
I can still press charges against him for ruining my
Camaro.”
“But—”
He raised his hand, and my mother flinched.
For the first time, I realized something.
Gabe had hit my mother.
I didn’t
know when, or how much.
But I was sure he’d done it.
Maybe it had been
going on for years, when I wasn’t around.
A balloon of anger started expanding in my chest.
I came toward Gabe,
instinctively taking my pen out of my pocket.
He just laughed.
“What, punk?
You gonna write on me?
You touch me,
and you are going to jail forever, you understand?”
“Hey, Gabe,” his friend Eddie interrupted.
“He’s just a kid.”
Gabe looked at him resentfully and mimicked in a falsetto voice: “Just a
kid.”
His other friends laughed like idiots.
“I’ll be nice to you, punk.”
Gabe showed me his tobacco-stained teeth.
“I’ll give you five minutes to get your stuff and clear out.
After that, I call the
police.”
“Gabe!”
my mother pleaded.
“He ran away,” Gabe told her.
“Let him stay gone.”
I was itching to uncap Riptide, but even if I did, the blade wouldn’t hurt
humans.
And Gabe, by the loosest definition, was human.
My mother took my arm.
“Please, Percy.
Come on.
We’ll go to your
room.”
I let her pull me away, my hands still trembling with rage.
My room had been completely filled with Gabe’s junk.
There were stacks
of used car batteries, a rotting bouquet of sympathy flowers with a card from
somebody who’d seen his Barbara Walters interview.
“Gabe is just upset, honey,” my mother told me.
“I’ll talk to him later.
I’m sure it will work out.”
“Mom, it’ll never work out.
Not as long as Gabe’s here.”
She wrung her hands nervously.
“I can…I’ll take you to work with me for
the rest of the summer.
In the fall, maybe there’s another boarding school—”
“Mom.”
She lowered her eyes.
“I’m trying, Percy.
I just…I need some time.”
A package appeared on my bed.
At least, I could’ve sworn it hadn’t been
there a moment before.
It was a battered cardboard box about the right size to fit a basketball.
The
address on the mailing slip was in my own handwriting:
The Gods
Mount Olympus
600th Floor,
Empire State Building
New York, NY
With best wishes,
PERCY JACKSON

Over the top in black marker, in a man’s clear, bold print, was the address

of our apartment, and the words: RETURN TO SENDER.
“Hey, Sally,” he yelled.
“What about that meat loaf, huh?”
A steely look of anger flared in my mother’s eyes, and I thought, just
maybe, I was leaving her in good hands after all.
Her own.
“The meat loaf is coming right up, dear,” she told Gabe.
“Meat loaf
surprise.”
She looked at me, and winked.
The last thing I saw as the door swung closed was my mother staring at
Gabe, as if she were contemplating how he would look as a garden statue.
TWENTY TWO

THE PROPHECY COMES TRUE
The guy said, "Sally, you're a riot.
You want some more wine?"
"Ah, I shouldn't.
You go ahead if you want.
"
"Actually, I'd better use your bathroom.
May I?"
"Down the hall," she said, trying not to laugh.
The actor dude smiled and got up and left.
"Mom!"
I said.
She jumped so hard she almost knocked her textbooks off the table.
Finally she focused
on me.
"Percy!
Oh, honey!
Is everything okay?
"
"What are you doing?"
I demanded.
She blinked.
"Homework."
Then she seemed to understand the look on my face.
"Oh,
honey, that's just Paul—um, Mr. Blofis.
He's in my writing seminar.
"
"Mr. Blowfish?"
"Blofis.
He'll be back in a minute, Percy.
Tell me what's wrong.
"
She always knew when something was wrong.
Would you mind getting it for me?"
"Sure, Sally.
No problem.
"
He left the room, and instantly my mom leaned toward the Iris-message.
"Percy!
Are
you all right?"

"I'm, uh, fine.
How's that writing seminar going?
"
She pursed her lips.
"It's fine.
But that's not important.
Tell me what's happened!"
I filled her in as quickly as I could.
"Well, maybe not to his face, anyway."
"Sally?"
Mr. Blofis called from our living room.
"You need the green binder or the red
one?"
"I'd better go," she told me.
"See you for Christmas?"
"Are you putting blue candy in my stocking?"
She smiled.
"If you're not too old for that.
"
"I'm never too old for candy.
"
"I'll see you then.
"
She waved her hand across the mist.
Her image disappeared, and I thought to myself
that Thalia had been right, so many days ago at Westover Hall: my mom really was pretty
cool.
Compared to Mount Olympus, Manhattan was quiet.
Friday before Christmas, but it
was early in the morning, and hardly anyone was on Fifth Avenue.
Argus, the many-eyed

security chief, picked up Annabeth, Grover, and me at the Empire State Building and ferried
us back to camp through a light snowstorm.
The Long Island Expressway was almost
deserted.
As we trudged back up Half-Blood Hill to the pine tree where the Golden Fleece
glittered, I half expected to see Thalia there, waiting for us.
But she wasn't.
She was long gone
with Artemis and the rest of the Hunters, off on their next adventure.
Chiron greeted us at the Big House with hot chocolate and toasted cheese sandwiches.
Grover went off with his satyr friends to spread the word about our strange encounter with the
magic of Pan.
Within an hour, the satyrs were all running around agitated, asking where the
nearest espresso bar was.
Sally, Paul,
Tyson…would you mind if I borrowed Percy for a moment?”
He put his arm around me and steered me into the kitchen.
***
Once we were alone, his smile faded.
“Are you all right, my boy?”
“Yeah.
I’m fine.
"Sally."
He put his hand over my mother's hands.
"I can't claim to know what you and Percy have
been going through all these years.
But it sounds to me . . .
it sounds like Percy is doing something noble.
I wish I had that much courage.
"
I got a lump in my throat.
I didn't get compliments like that too much.
My mom stared at her lemonade.
She looked like she was trying not to cry.
I thought about what
Hestia had said, about how hard it was to yield, and I figured maybe my mom was finding that out.
"Percy," she said, "I give you my blessing.
"
I didn't feel any different.
No magic glow lit the kitchen or anything.
I glanced at Nico.
He looked more anxious than ever, but he nodded.
"It's time."
"Percy," my mom said.
"One last thing.
If you . .
.
if you survive this fight with Kronos, send me a
sign."
She rummaged through her purse and handed me her cell phone.
"Mom," I said, "you know demigods and phones—"
"I know," she said.
"But just in case.
If you're not able to call . . .
maybe a sign that I could see from
anywhere in Manhattan.
To let me know you're okay."
"Like Theseus," Paul suggested.
"He was supposed to raise white sails when he came home to
Athens."
"Except he forgot," Nico muttered.
"And his father jumped off the palace roof in despair.
But other
than that, it was a great idea."
"What about a flag or a flare?"
my mom said.
"From Olympus—the Empire State Building."
"Something blue," I said.
We'd had a running joke for years about blue food.
It was my favorite color, and my mom went out of
her way to humor me.
Every year my birthday cake, my Easter basket, my Christmas candy canes always
had to be blue.
"Yes," my mom agreed.
"I'll watch for a blue signal.
And I'll try to avoid jumping off palace roofs.
"
She gave me one last hug.
I tried not to feel like I was saying good-bye.
I shook hands with Paul.
Then Nico and I walked to the kitchen doorway and looked at Mrs. O'Leary.
"Sorry, girl," I said.
"Shadow travel time again.
"

She whimpered and crossed her paws over her snout.
"Where now?" I asked Nico.
"Los Angeles?"
"No need," he said.
"There's a closer entrance to the Underworld.
"

SEVEN
MY MATH TEACHER
GIVES ME A LIFT
We emerged in Central Park just north of the Pond.
Mrs. O'Leary looked pretty tired as she limped over to
a cluster of boulders.
She started sniffing around, and I was afraid she might mark her territory, but Nico
said, "It's okay.
She just smells the way home.
"
I frowned.
"Through the rocks?"
"The Underworld has two major entrances," Nico said.
"You know the one in L.A."
"Charon's ferry.
"
Nico nodded.
"Most souls go that way, but there's a smaller path, harder to find.
The Door of
Orpheus."
"The dude with the harp."
"Dude with the lyre," Nico corrected.
"But yeah, him.
He used his music to charm the earth and open
a new path into the Underworld.
He sang his way right into Hades's palace and almost got away with his
wife's soul.
"
I remembered the story.
Orpheus wasn't supposed to look behind him when he was leading his wife
back to the world, but of course he did.
It was one of those typical "and-so-they-died/the-end" stories that
always made us feel warm and fuzzy.
"So this is the Door of Orpheus."
I tried to be impressed, but it still looked like a pile of rocks to me.
"How does it open?
"
"We need music," Nico said.
"How's your singing?"
"Um, no.
Can't you just, like, tell it to open?
You're the son of Hades and all."
"It's not so easy.
We need music.
"
I was pretty sure if I tried to sing, all I would cause was an avalanche.
"I have a better idea."
I turned and called, "GROVER!"
We waited for a long time.
Mrs. O'Leary curled up and took a nap.
I could hear the crickets in the woods
and an owl hooting.
Traffic hummed along Central Park West.
Horse hooves clopped down a nearby path,

maybe a mounted police patrol.
I was sure they'd love to find two kids hanging out in the park at one in
the morning.
"It's no good," Nico said at last.
But I had a feeling.
