“Hello, Sally,” Poseidon said.
“You look as beautiful as ever.
May I come
in?”
My mother made a squeaking sound that might’ve been either a “Yes” or
“Help.”
Poseidon took it as a yes and came in.
Paul was looking back and forth between us, trying to read our
expressions.
Finally he stepped forward.
“Hi, I’m Paul Blofis.”
Poseidon raised his eyebrows as they shook hands.
“Blowfish, did you
say?”
“Ah, no.
Blofis, actually.”
“Oh, I see,” Poseidon said.
“A shame.
I quite like blowfish.
I am
Poseidon.”
“Poseidon?
That’s an interesting name.”
“Yes, I like it.
I’ve gone by other names, but I do prefer Poseidon.”
“Like the god of the sea.”

“Very much like that, yes.”
“Well!”
my mom interrupted.
“Um, we’re so glad you could drop by.
Paul,
this is Percy’s father.”
“Ah.”
Paul nodded, though he didn’t look real pleased.
“I see.”
Poseidon smiled at me.
“There you are, my boy.
And Tyson, hello, son!”
“Daddy!”
Tyson bounded across the room and gave Poseidon a big hug,
which almost knocked off his fishing hat.
Paul’s jaw dropped.
He stared at my mom.
“Tyson is…”
“Not mine,” she promised.
“It’s a long story.”
“I couldn’t miss Percy’s fifteenth birthday,” Poseidon said.
“Why, if this
were Sparta, Percy would be a man today!”
“That’s true,” Paul said.
“I used to teach ancient history.”
Poseidon’s eyes twinkled.
“That’s me.
Ancient history.
Sally, Paul,
Tyson…would you mind if I borrowed Percy for a moment?”
He put his arm around me and steered me into the kitchen.
***
Once we were alone, his smile faded.
“Are you all right, my boy?”
“Yeah.
I’m fine.
I guess.”
“I heard stories,” Poseidon said.
“But I wanted to hear it directly from you.
Tell me everything.”
So I did.
It was kind of disconcerting, because Poseidon listened so
intently.
His eyes never left my face.
His expression didn’t change the whole
time I talked.
When I was done, he nodded slowly.
“So Kronos is indeed back.
It will not be long before full war is upon us.”
“What about Luke?”
I asked.
“Is he really gone?”
“I don’t know, Percy.
It is most disturbing.”
“But his body is mortal.
Couldn’t you just destroy him?”
“Mortal, perhaps, but there is something different about Luke, my boy.
I
don’t know how he was prepared to host the Titan’s soul, but he will not be
easily killed.
And yet, I fear he must be killed if we are to send Kronos back
to the pit.
I will have to think on this.
Unfortunately, I have other problems
of my own.”
I remembered what Tyson had told me at the beginning of the summer.
“The old sea gods?”

“Indeed.
The battle came first to me, Percy.
In fact, I cannot stay long.
Even now the ocean is at war with itself.
It is all I can do to keep hurricanes
and typhoons from destroying your surface world, the fighting is so intense.”
“Let me come down there,” I said.
“Let me help.”
Poseidon’s eyes crinkled as he smiled.
“Not yet, my boy.
I sense you will
be needed here.
Which reminds me…” He brought out a sand dollar and
pressed it into my hand.
“Your birthday present.
Spend it wisely.”
“Uh, spend a sand dollar?”
“Oh, yes.
In my day, you could buy quite a lot with a sand dollar.
I think
you will find it still buys a lot, if used in the right situation.”
“What situation?”
“When the time comes,” Poseidon said, “I think you’ll know.”
I closed my hand around the sand dollar, but something was really
bothering me.
“Dad,” I said, “when I was in the maze, I met Antaeus.
He said…well, he
said he was your favorite son.
He decorated his arena with skulls and—”
“He dedicated them to me,” Poseidon supplied.
“And you are wondering
how someone could do something so horrible in my name.”
I nodded uncomfortably.
Poseidon put his weathered hand on my shoulder.
“Percy, lesser beings do
many horrible things in the name of the gods.
That does not mean we gods
approve.
The way our sons and daughters act in our names…well, it usually
says more about them than it does about us.
And you, Percy, are my favorite
son.”
He smiled, and at that moment, just being in the kitchen with him was the
best birthday present I ever got.
Then my mom called from the living room.
“Percy?
The candles are melting!”
“You’d better go,” Poseidon said.
“But, Percy, one last thing you should
know.
That incident at Mount St. Helens…”
For a second I thought he was talking about Annabeth kissing me, and I
blushed, but then I realized he was talking about something a lot bigger.
“The eruptions are continuing,” he said.
“Typhon is stirring.
It is very
likely that soon, in a few months, perhaps a year at best, he will escape his
bonds.”
“I’m sorry,” I said.
“I didn’t mean—”
Poseidon raised his hand.
“It is not your fault, Percy.
It would’ve
happened sooner or later, with Kronos awakening the ancient monsters.
But
be aware, if Typhon stirs…it will be unlike anything you have faced before.
The first time he appeared, all the forces of Olympus were barely enough to

battle him.
And when he stirs again, he will come here, to New York.
He
will make straight for Olympus.”
That was just the kind of wonderful news I wanted to get on my birthday,
but Poseidon patted me on the back like everything was fine.
“I should go.
Enjoy your cake.”
And just like that he turned to mist and was swept out the window on a
warm ocean breeze.
***
It took a little work to convince Paul that Poseidon had left via the fire
escape, but since people can’t vanish into thin air, he had no choice but to
believe it.
We ate blue cake and ice cream until we couldn’t eat anymore.
Then we
played a bunch of cheesy party games like charades and Monopoly.
Tyson
didn’t get charades.
He kept shouting out the answer he was trying to mime,
but it turned out he was really good at Monopoly.
He knocked me out of the
game in the first five rounds and started bankrupting my mom and Paul.
I
left them playing and went into my bedroom.
I set an uneaten slice of blue cake on my dresser.
Then I took off my
Camp Half-Blood necklace and laid it on the windowsill.
There were three
beads now, representing my three summers at camp—a trident, the Golden
Fleece, and the latest: an intricate maze, symbolizing the Battle of the
Labyrinth, as the campers had started to call it.
I wondered what next year’s
bead would be, if I was still around to get it.
If the camp survived until next
summer.
I looked at the phone by my bedside.
I thought about calling Rachel
Elizabeth Dare.
My mom had asked me if there was anyone else I wanted to
have over tonight, and I’d thought about Rachel.
But I didn’t call.
I don’t
know why.
The idea made me almost as nervous as a door into the Labyrinth.
I patted my pockets and emptied out my stuff—Riptide, a Kleenex, my
apartment key.
Then I patted my shirt pocket and felt a small lump.
I hadn’t
even realized it, but I was wearing the white cotton shirt Calypso had given
me on Ogygia.
I brought out a little piece of cloth, unwrapped it, and found
the clipping of moonlace.
It was a tiny sprig, shriveled up after two months,
but I could still smell the faint scent of the enchanted garden.
It made me sad.
I remembered Calypso’s last request of me: Plant a garden in Manhattan
for me, will you?
I opened the window and stepped onto the fire escape.
My mom kept a planter box out there.
In the spring she usually filled it
with flowers, but now it was all dirt, waiting for something new.
It was a
clear night.
The moon was full over Eighty-second Street.
I planted the dried
sprig of moonlace carefully in the dirt and sprinkled a little nectar on it from
my camp canteen.
Nothing happened at first.
Then, as I watched, a tiny silver plant sprang out of the soil—a baby
moonlace, growing in the warm summer night.
“Nice plant,” a voice said.
I jumped.
Nico di Angelo was standing on the fire escape right next to me.
He’d just appeared there.
“Sorry,” he said.
“Didn’t mean to startle you.”
“That’s—that’s okay.
I mean…what are you doing here?”
He’d grown about an inch taller over the last couple of months.
His hair
was a shaggy black mess.
He wore a black T-shirt, black jeans, and a new
silver ring shaped like a skull.
His Stygian iron sword hung at his side.
“I’ve done some exploring,” he said.
“Thought you’d like to know,
Daedalus got his punishment.”
“You saw him?”
Nico nodded.
“Minos wanted to boil him in cheese fondue for an eternity,
but my father had other ideas.
Daedalus will be building overpasses and exit
ramps in Asphodel for all time.
It’ll help ease the traffic congestion.
Truthfully, I think the old guy is pretty happy with that.
He’s still building.
Still creating.
And he gets to see his son and Perdix on the weekends.”
“That’s good.”
Nico tapped at his silver ring.
“But that’s not the real reason I’ve come.
I’ve found out some things.
I want to make you an offer.”
“What?”
“The way to beat Luke,” he said.
“If I’m right, it’s the only way you’ll
stand a chance.”
I took a deep breath.
“Okay.
I’m listening.”
Nico glanced inside my room.
His eyebrows furrowed.
“Is that…is that
blue birthday cake?”
He sounded hungry, maybe a little wistful.
I wondered if the poor kid had
ever had a birthday party, or if he’d ever even been invited to one.
“Come inside for some cake and ice cream,” I said.
“It sounds like we’ve
got a lot to talk about.”
