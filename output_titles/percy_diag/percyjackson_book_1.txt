I’m going to kill her,
It’s okay. I like peanut butter.
That’s it.
You’re already on probation,
You’re absolutely right.
Will you shut up?
Mr. Jackson,
did you have a comment?
No, sir.
That’s Kronos eating his kids, right?
Yes,
Well…
God?
Titan,
Eeew!
—and so there was this big fight between the gods and the Titans,
and the gods won.
And why, Mr. Jackson,
Busted,
Shut up,
I don’t know, sir.
I see.
Sir?
You must learn the answer to my question,
About the Titans?
About real life. And how your studies apply to it.
Oh.
What you learn from me,
What ho!
Detention?
Nah,
Can I have your apple?
Oops.
Count to ten, get control of your temper.
Percy pushed me!
Did you see—
—the water—
—like it grabbed her—
Now, honey—
I know,
A month erasing workbooks.
Come with me,
Wait!
It was me. I pushed her.
I don’t think so, Mr. Underwood,
But—
You—will—stay—here.
It’s okay, man,
Thanks for trying.
Honey,
Now.
You’ve been giving us problems, honey,
Yes, ma’am.
I’ll—I’ll try harder, ma’am.
We are not fools, Percy Jackson,
Well?
Ma’am, I don’t…
Your time is up,
What ho, Percy!
Die, honey!
Who?
Our teacher. Duh!
Who?
Not funny, man,
This is serious.
Sir,
where’s Mrs. Dodds?
Who?
The other chaperone. Mrs. Dodds. The pre-algebra teacher.
…worried about Percy, sir.
…alone this summer,
We would only make matters worse by rushing him,
We need the boy to mature more.
But he may not have time. The summer solstice deadline—
Sir, he saw her.…
His imagination,
Sir, I…I can’t fail in my duties again.
You know what that would mean.
You haven’t failed, Grover,
Nothing,
My nerves haven’t been right since the winter solstice.
Mine neither,
But I could have sworn…
Go back to the dorm,
Don’t remind me.
Hey,
You going to be ready for this test?
You look awful.
Is everything okay?
Just…tired.
Percy,
Okay, sir.
I mean…
Right,
No, no,
Thanks,
Thanks a lot, sir, for reminding me.
Percy—
Oh,
That’s cool.
Looking for Kindly Ones?
Wha—what do you mean?
How much did you hear?
Oh…not much. What’s the summer solstice deadline?
Grover—
Grover, you’re a really, really bad liar.
What’s Half—
Don’t say it aloud!
That’s my, um…summer address.
Okay,
So, like, if I want to come visit your mansion.
Or…or if you need me.
Why would I need you?
Grover,
what exactly are you protecting me from?
Grover?
Hey, man—
Tell me they’re not looking at you. They are, aren’t they?
Yeah. Weird, huh? You think those socks would fit me?
Not funny, Percy. Not funny at all.
We’re getting on the bus,
Come on.
What?
It’s a thousand degrees in there.
Come on!
Darn right!
Everybody back on board!
Grover?
Yeah?
What are you not telling me?
The middle one took out her scissors, and she cut the yarn.
You saw her snip the cord.
Yeah. So?
This is not happening,
I don’t want this to be like the last time.
What last time?
Always sixth grade. They never get past sixth.
Grover,
Let me walk you home from the bus station. Promise me.
Is this like a superstition or something?
Why does this always happen?
Why does it always have to be sixth grade?
East One-hundred-and-fourth and First,
So, you’re home.
Where’s my mom?
Working,
You got any cash?
guy secret.
I don’t have any cash,
You took a taxi from the bus station,
Come on, Gabe,
The kid just got here.
Am I right?
Fine,
I hope you lose.
Your report card came, brain boy!
study.
Percy?
Oh, Percy.
What?
Did something scare you?
No, Mom.
I have a surprise for you,
We’re going to the beach.
Montauk?
Three nights—same cabin.
When?
As soon as I get changed.
I was on my way, honey,
I knew it,
He won’t let us go.
Of course he will,
Yes, honey,
And you won’t take my car anywhere but there and back.
We’ll be very careful.
Maybe if you hurry with that sevenlayer dip…And maybe if the kid apologizes for interrupting my poker game.
I’m sorry,
Yeah, whatever,
Thank you, Percy,
Not a scratch on this car, brain boy,
Not one little scratch.
He was kind, Percy,
How old was I?
I mean…when he left?
But…he knew me as a baby.
Are you going to send me away again?
I don’t know, honey.
Because you don’t want me around?
Because I’m not normal,
Safe from what?
I’ve tried to keep you as close to me as I could,
My father wanted me to go to a special school?
Not a school,
A summer camp.
I’m sorry, Percy,
For good? But if it’s only a summer camp…
Hurricane.
Searching all night,
What were you thinking?
Percy,
O Zeu kai alloi theoi!
Percy. Tell me now!
So, you and my mom…know each other?
Not exactly,
Watching me?
I am your friend.
Um…what are you, exactly?
That doesn’t matter right now.
It doesn’t matter? From the waist down, my best friend is a donkey—
Blaa-ha-ha!
Goat!
What?
I’m a goat from the waist down.
You just said it didn’t matter.
Whoa. Wait. Satyrs. You mean like…Mr. Brunner’s myths?
So you admit there was a Mrs. Dodds!
Of course.
Then why—
The less you knew, the fewer monsters you’d attract,
Who I—wait a minute, what do you mean?
Percy,
Safety from what? Who’s after me?
Oh, nobody much,
Grover!
Sorry, Mrs. Jackson. Could you drive faster, please?
Where are we going?
The summer camp I told you about.
The place you didn’t want me to go.
Please, dear,
Because some old ladies cut yarn.
Those weren’t old ladies,
Whoa. You said ‘you.’
No I didn’t. I said ‘someone.’
You meant ‘you.’ As in me.
I meant you, like ‘someone.’ Not you, you.
Boys!
What was that?
We’re almost there,
Ow.
Percy!
I’m okay.…
Grover!
Food,
Percy,
we have to…
Who is—
Percy,
Get out of the car.
Climb out the passenger’s side!
What?
That’s the property line,
Mom, you’re coming too.
No!
You are coming with me. Help me carry Grover.
Food!
He doesn’t want us,
But…
We don’t have time, Percy. Go. Please.
I told you—
Mom! I am not leaving you. Help me with Grover.
That’s—
Pasiphae’s son,
But he’s the Min—
Don’t say his name,
Names have power.
Food?
Shhh,
Mom, what’s he doing? Doesn’t he see us?
His sight and hearing are terrible,
Percy,
How do you know all this?
Keeping me near you? But—
Run, Percy!
I can’t go any farther. Run!
Mom!
Go!
No!
Hey!
Hey, stupid! Ground beef!
Raaaarrrrr!
Food!
He’s the one. He must be.
Silence, Annabeth,
What?
I’m sorry,
I don’t…
Careful,
You saved my life,
The Minotaur,
Um, Percy, it isn’t a good idea—
That’s what they call him in the Greek myths, isn’t it?
The Minotaur. Half man, half bull.
My mom. Is she really…
I’m sorry,
Oh, Styx!
It wasn’t your fault.
Yes, it was. I was supposed to protect you.
Did my mother ask you to protect me?
No. But that’s my job. I’m a keeper. At least…I was.
But why…
Don’t strain yourself,
Here.
Was it good?
What did it taste like?
Sorry,
I should’ve let you taste.
No! That’s not what I meant. I just…wondered.
Chocolate-chip cookies,
My mom’s. Homemade.
And how do you feel?
Like I could throw Nancy Bobofit a hundred yards.
That’s good,
What do you mean?
Come on. Chiron and Mr. D are waiting.
That’s Mr. D,
Mr. Brunner!
Ah, good, Percy,
Now we have four for pinochle.
Uh, thanks.
Annabeth?
Sure, Chiron.
You drool when you sleep.
So,
Not Mr. Brunner,
Okay.
Oh. Right. Sorry.
I must say, Percy,
House call?
You came to Yancy just to teach me?
Grover,
are you playing or not?
Yes, sir!
You do know how to play pinochle?
I’m afraid not,
I’m afraid not, sir,
Sir,
Well,
I’m sure the boy can learn,
Please,
I asked the same question.
Percy,
Did your mother tell you nothing?
She said…
Typical,
What?
I’m afraid there’s too much to tell,
Orientation film?
No,
Mr. D,
Eh? Oh, all right.
Wait,
You’re telling me there’s such a thing as God.
Well, now,
Metaphysical? But you were just talking about—
Smaller?
Yes, quite. The gods we discussed in Latin class.
Zeus,
Hera. Apollo. You mean them.
Young man,
But they’re stories,
Science!
And tell me, Perseus Jackson
Percy,
You mean, whether people believed in you or not,
Exactly,
Oh, you’d better,
P-please, sir. He’s just lost his mother. He’s in shock.
A lucky thing, too,
Mr. D,
your restrictions.
Dear me.
Old habits! Sorry!
A wood nymph,
Yes,
And…
your father is…
Di immortales, Chiron,
You’re Dionysus,
The god of wine.
Y-yes, Mr. D.
You’re a god.
Yes, child.
A god. You.
Would you like to test me, child?
No. No, sir.
I believe I win.
Not quite, Mr. D,
The game goes to me.
I’m tired,
Y-yes, sir.
Will Grover be okay?
Mount Olympus,
You mean the Greek gods are here? Like…in America?
Well, certainly. The gods move with the heart of the West.
The what?
And then they died.
Who are you, Chiron? Who…who am I?
Who are you?
What a relief,
That’s him.
What’s up there?
Just the attic.
Somebody lives there?
No,
Not a single living thing.
Come along, Percy,
Lots to see.
It pays our expenses,
Grover won’t get in too much trouble, will he?
But he did that!
I might agree with you,
He’ll get a second chance, won’t he?
How old is he?
Oh, twenty-eight.
What! And he’s in sixth grade?
That’s horrible.
Quite,
That’s not fair,
Let’s move along, shall we?
Chiron,
If the gods and Olympus and all that are real…
Yes, child?
Does that mean the Underworld is real, too?
Yes, child.
What do you mean, ‘until we know more’?
Come, Percy. Let’s see the woods.
Stocked with what?
Armed with what?
My own—?
No,
Sword and spear fights?
Cabin challenges and all that,
What do you do when it rains?
Zeus and Hera?
Correct,
Their cabins look empty.
Several of the cabins are. That’s true. No one ever stays in one or two.
No,
You said your name was Chiron. Are you really…
But, shouldn’t you be dead?
Doesn’t it ever get boring?
No, no,
Horribly depressing, at times, but never boring.
Why depressing?
Oh, look,
Annabeth is waiting for us.
Annabeth,
Yes, sir.
Cabin eleven,
Well, then,
Good luck, Percy. I’ll see you at dinner.
Well?
Go on.
Percy Jackson, meet cabin eleven.
Regular or undetermined?
Undetermined.
This is Luke,
He’s your counselor for now.
For now?
You’re undetermined,
How long will I be here?
Good question,
Until you’re determined.
How long will that take?
Come on,
I’ll show you the volleyball court.
I’ve already seen it.
Come on.
What?
What’s your problem?
Don’t talk like that!
To get killed?
To fight the Minotaur! What do you think we train for?
Yes.
Then there’s only one.
Yes.
Monsters don’t die, Percy. They can be killed. But they don’t die.
Oh, thanks. That clears it up.
How did you know about Mrs. Dodds?
You talk in your sleep.
Look, is there anything we can say without it thundering?
My mom is Sally Jackson,
He’s dead. I never knew him.
Your father’s not dead, Percy.
How can you say that? You know him?
No, of course not.
Then how can you say—
Because I know you. You wouldn’t be here if you weren’t one of us.
You don’t know anything about me.
No?
How—
Diagnosed with dyslexia. Probably ADHD, too.
You sound like…you went through the same thing?
Ambrosia and nectar.
Well! A newbie!
Clarisse,
Sure, Miss Princess,
Erre es korakas!
You don’t stand a chance.
We’ll pulverize you,
Who’s this little runt?
Percy Jackson,
meet Clarisse, Daughter of Ares.
Like…the war god?
You got a problem with that?
No,
It explains the bad smell.
We got an initiation ceremony for newbies, Prissy.
Percy.
Whatever. Come on, I’ll show you.
Clarisse—
Stay out of it, wise girl.
Like he’s ‘Big Three’ material,
How did you…
I don’t know.
You are dead, new boy. You are totally dead.
What?
What are you thinking?
I’m thinking,
I’ve got training to do,
Annabeth, I’m sorry about the toilets.
Whatever.
It wasn’t my fault.
You need to talk to the Oracle,
Who?
Not who. What. The Oracle. I’ll ask Chiron.
Don’t encourage them,
Naiads are terrible flirts.
Naiads,
You mean, mentally disturbed kids?
I mean not human. Not totally human, anyway. Half-human.
Half-human and half-what?
I think you know.
God,
Half-god.
That’s…crazy.
But those are just—
But if all the kids here are half-gods—
Demigods,
That’s the official term. Or half-bloods.
Then who’s your dad?
My dad is a professor at West Point,
He’s human.
Who’s your mom, then?
Cabin six.
Meaning?
Athena. Goddess of wisdom and battle.
And my dad?
Undetermined,
like I told you before. Nobody knows.
Except my mother. She knew.
Maybe not, Percy. Gods don’t always reveal their identities.
My dad would have. He loved her.
You mean sometimes it doesn’t?
So I’m stuck here,
That’s it? For the rest of my life?
It depends,
So monsters can’t get in here?
Why would anybody want to summon a monster?
Practice fights. Practical jokes.
Practical jokes?
So…you’re a year-rounder?
I’ve been here since I was seven,
Why did you come so young?
None of your business.
Oh.
Unless?
Back in the sick room,
when you were feeding me that stuff—
Ambrosia.
Yeah. You asked me something about the summer solstice.
So you do know something?
You’ve been to Olympus?
But…how did you get there?
Oh, sure.
Right after we visited,
I’ve got to get a quest,
Found you a sleeping bag,
Thanks.
No prob.
I don’t belong here,
I don’t even believe in gods.
Yeah,
So your dad is Hermes?
Yeah. Hermes.
The wing-footed messenger guy.
You ever meet your dad?
Once.
I hate prophecies.
What do you mean?
Somebody special?
Don’t worry about it, kid,
Eleven, fall in!
To the gods!
To the gods!
Speak to it. Whatever you want—nonalcoholic, of course.
Cherry Coke.
Blue Cherry Coke.
Here you go, Percy,
Come on,
You’re kidding.
Hermes.
Personally,
Er, Percy Jackson,
There’s more where that came from, punk,
Good luck,
Maybe he’ll go easy on me,
Lunge!
Now, back!
Okay, everybody circle up!
This is difficult,
Now in real time,
Um, sorry.
Sorry?
Beginner’s luck?
Maybe,
Fine,
Just great.
So your career’s still on track?
Well…no.
Well, that’s not so bad, right?
Of course I’d want you along!
Number eight, the silver one, belongs to Artemis,
Zeus, Poseidon, Hades.
Zeus got the sky,
Uh-huh.
But Hades doesn’t have a cabin here.
Well, it wouldn’t be pleasant. Let’s leave it at that.
That’s the most serious oath you can make.
And the brothers kept their word—no kids?
But that isn’t fair! It wasn’t the little girl’s fault.
Grover,
have heroes really gone on quests to the Underworld?
Sometimes,
Orpheus. Hercules. Houdini.
And have they ever returned somebody from the dead?
No,
Those are the flags?
Yeah.
Ares and Athena always lead the teams?
Not always,
But often.
So, if another cabin captures one, what do you do—repaint the flag?
You’ll see. First we have to get one.
Whose side are we on?
Heroes!
Whoa,
We’re really supposed to use these?
Blue team, forward!
Hey.
So what’s the plan?
Got any magic items you can loan me?
Just watch Clarisse’s spear,
Border patrol, whatever that means.
Okay,
Glad you wanted me on your team.
Cream the punk!
Give him a haircut,
Grab his hair.
Oh, wow,
I’m scared of this guy. Really scared.
The flag is that way,
Yeah,
You do that without my help,
No maiming,
Oops,
Guess I lost my dessert privilege.
Ah!
You idiot! You corpse-breath worm!
A trick!
It was a trick.
Not bad, hero.
Where the heck did you learn to fight like that?
You set me up,
I told you. Athena always, always has a plan.
A plan to get me pulverized.
I came as fast as I could. I was about to jump in, but…
You didn’t need help.
How did you do that?
Sword cut,
What do you think?
No. It was a sword cut. Look at it.
I—I don’t get it,
What—
Just do it.
Oh, Styx,
Stand ready! My bow!
Percy, run!
Di immortales!
Someone summoned it,
Someone inside the camp.
It’s all Percy’s fault! Percy summoned it!
Be quiet, child,
You’re wounded,
Quick, Percy, get in the water.
I’m okay.
No, you’re not,
Chiron, watch this.
Look, I—I don’t know why,
I’m sorry.…
Percy,
Um…
Your father,
This is really not good.
It is determined,
My father?
Poseidon,
lights out
You’re going to need all the training you can get,
Lights out,
Come in?
Mr. D wants to see you.
Why?
He wants to kill…I mean, I’d better let him tell you.
No,
It never rains here unless we want it to.
What the heck is that, then?
Well, well,
Our little celebrity.
Come closer,
Blah, blah, blah,
If I had my way,
Spontaneous combustion is a form of harm, Mr. D,
Nonsense,
Mr. D—
Oh, all right,
Tell me, Percy,
What did you make of the hellhound?
It scared me,
If you hadn’t shot it, I’d be dead.
You’ll meet worse, Percy. Far worse, before you’re done.
Done…with what?
Your quest, of course. Will you accept it?
Um, sir,
you haven’t told me what it is yet.
Well, that’s the hard part, the details.
Poseidon and Zeus,
How did you know that?
I knew it,
Hush, satyr,
But it is his quest!
Only the Oracle can determine.
A what?
Do not take this lightly,
Oh.
Zeus’s master bolt,
And it’s missing?
Stolen,
By who?
By whom,
At least
But I didn’t—
Patience and listen, child,
But I’ve never even been to Olympus! Zeus is crazy!
Er, Percy…?
Perhaps paranoid,
Something about a golden net?
Correct,
But I’m just a kid!
Percy,
Bad?
Bad,
And you, Percy Jackson, would be the first to feel Zeus’s wrath.
So I have to find the stupid bolt,
And return it to Zeus.
What better peace offering,
If Poseidon doesn’t have it, where is the thing?
I believe I know.
Why can’t you tell me where the bolt is beforehand?
Because if I did, you would be too afraid to accept the challenge.
Good reason.
You agree then?
All right,
It’s better than being turned into a dolphin.
Then it’s time you consulted the Oracle,
What is my destiny?
Well?
That’s great!
What did the Oracle say exactly?
This is important.
I knew it,
Anything else?
No,
That’s about it.
Okay,
Ah, think, Percy,
Somebody else who wants to take over?
Hades.
The Lord of the Dead is the only possibility.
Whoa, wait. Whwhat?
A Fury came after Percy,
Yes, but—but Hades hates all heroes,
A hellhound got into the forest,
Great,
That’s two major gods who want to kill me.
But a quest to…
Hades sent a minion to steal the master bolt,
Look, if we know it’s Hades,
Suspecting and knowing are not the same,
You’re saying I’m being used.
I had my suspicions. As I said…I’ve spoken to the Oracle, too.
So let me get this straight,
Check,
Find the most powerful weapon in the universe.
Check.
And get it back to Olympus before the summer solstice, in ten days.
That’s about right.
Did I mention that Maine is very nice this time of year?
You don’t have to go,
I can’t ask that of you.
Oh…
All the way, G-man.
Where?
Oh,
Naturally. So we just get on a plane—
No!
Percy, think,
Okay,
That’s right,
Gee,
I’ve been waiting a long time for a quest, seaweed brain,
If you do say so yourself,
I suppose you have a plan, wise girl?
Do you want my help or not?
A trio,
That’ll work.
Excellent,
No time to waste,
I think you should all get packing.
So Yesterday,
This is Argus,
Hey!
Glad I caught you.
Just wanted to say good luck,
Maia!
Awesome!
Hey, man,
Thanks.
Listen, Percy…
You’re hyperventilating.
Am not.
You let him capture the flag instead of you, didn’t you?
Oh…why do I want to go anywhere with you, Percy?
I won’t be able to use these, will I?
Me?
Maia!
Practice,
You just need practice!
Aaaaa!
That’s okay. I just wish—
What am I thinking?
Gee,
Thanks.
The sword has a long and tragic history that we need not go into,
Its name is Anaklusmos.
‘Riptide,’
Use it only for emergencies,
Good to know.
Now recap the pen.
You can’t,
Can’t what?
Lose the pen,
It may take a few moments,
Now check your pocket.
Okay, that’s extremely cool,
Mist is a powerful thing, Percy.
Mist?
Chiron…
So what was it like…before the gods?
Our destiny…assuming we know what that is.
Relax,
Relax,
I’m very relaxed.
So far so good,
Ten miles and not a single monster.
Remind me again—why do you hate me so much?
I don’t hate you.
Could’ve fooled me.
Why?
They must really like olives.
Oh, forget it.
Now, if she’d invented pizza—that I could understand.
I said, forget it!
You want to know why she married him, Percy?
Were you reading my mind or something?
Just your emotions.
Your mom married Gabe for you,
Thanks,
Where’s the nearest shower?
What is it?
I don’t know,
Maybe it’s nothing.
Percy.
She didn’t stay dead long,
I thought you said they could be dispelled for a lifetime.
I said if you’re lucky,
You’re obviously not.
All three of them,
Di immortales!
It’s okay,
They don’t open,
A back exit?
They won’t attack us with witnesses around,
Will they?
Mortals don’t have good eyes,
They’ll see three old ladies killing us, won’t they?
I need to use the rest-room.
So do I,
So do I,
I’ve got it,
Percy, take my hat.
What?
But you guys—
There’s an outside chance they might not notice us,
You’re a son of one of the Big Three. Your smell might be overpowering.
I can’t just leave you.
Don’t worry about us,
Go!
Where is it? Where?
He’s not here!
He’s gone!
Hey!
Hey—whoa!
Hey!
Perseus Jackson,
I liked you better as a math teacher,
Submit now,
And you will not suffer eternal torment.
Nice try,
Percy, look out!
Ow!
Ow! Hot! Hot!
Zeus will destroy you!
Hades will have your soul!
Braccas meas vescimini!
Eat my pants!
Get out!
Now!
Our bags!
We left our—
Run!
Three Kindly Ones. All three at once.
All our money was back there,
Well, maybe if you hadn’t decided to jump into the fight—
What did you want me to do? Let you get killed?
You didn’t need to protect me, Percy. I would’ve been fine.
Sliced like sandwich bread,
but fine.
Shut up, goat boy,
Tin cans…a perfectly good bag of tin cans.
Look, I…
We’re a team, right?
You haven’t left Camp Half-Blood since you were seven?
No…only short field trips. My dad—
The history professor.
Yeah. It didn’t work out for me living at home. I mean, Camp HalfBlood is my home.
You’re pretty good with that knife,
You think so?
Anybody who can piggyback-ride a Fury is okay by me.
You know,
Hey, my reed pipes still work!
What the heck does that say?
I don’t know,
Aunty Em’s Garden Gnome Emporium.
Hey…
The lights are on inside,
Maybe it’s open.
Snack bar,
Snack bar,
Are you two crazy?
This place is weird.
Bla-ha-ha!
Looks like my Uncle Ferdinand!
Don’t knock,
I smell monsters.
Your nose is clogged up from the Furies,
Meat!
I’m a vegetarian.
You eat cheese enchiladas and aluminum cans,
They’re…um…
We’re orphans,
Orphans?
We got separated from our caravan,
Oh, my dears,
Circus caravan?
Always have a strategy, right?
Your head is full of kelp.
Please, sit down,
Awesome,
Um,
we don’t have any money, ma’am.
Thank you, ma’am,
Quite all right, Annabeth,
What’s that hissing noise?
Hissing?
I take vitamins. For my ears.
That’s admirable,
But please, relax.
So, you sell gnomes,
Oh, yes,
A lot of business on this road?
Ah,
You make these statues yourself ?
Two sisters?
It’s a terrible story,
Percy?
Maybe we should go. I mean, the ringmaster will be waiting.
Such beautiful gray eyes,
We really should go.
Yes!
Please, dears,
A pose?
Sure we can,
Yes, Annabeth,
No harm.
Now,
Not much light for a photo,
Oh, enough,
Enough for us to see each other, yes?
Where’s your camera?
Grover,
look this way, dear.
Percy—
I will just be a moment,
Percy, something’s wrong,
Wrong?
Not at all, dear. I have such noble company tonight. What could be wrong?
That is Uncle Ferdinand!
Look away from her!
No! Don’t!
Run!
Maia!
Such a pity to destroy a handsome young face,
Stay with me, Percy. All you have to do is look up.
M.
The Gray-Eyed One did this to me, Percy,
Don’t listen to her!
Run, Percy!
Silence!
No,
Do you really want to help the gods?
Percy!
Duck!
Duck!
I’ll get her!
You miserable satyr,
I’ll add you to my collection!
That was for Uncle Ferdinand!
Arrgh!
Percy!
What? Are you crazy? Let’s get out of here.
Medusa is a menace. She’s evil. I’d kill her myself, but…
What? I can’t—
Look, do you want her turning more innocent people into statues?
Would you speak English?
I am!
Hey, guys!
Roooaaarrr!
Maybe not,
Hurry,
Ummphh!
Hey!
You wouldn’t harm an old woman, Percy,
Percy, don’t listen to her!
Too late.
Oh, yuck,
Mega-yuck.
Don’t move.
Are you okay?
Yeah,
Why didn’t…why didn’t the head evaporate?
Once you sever it, it becomes a spoil of war,
The Red Baron,
Good job, man.
So we have Athena to thank for this monster?
Oh, so now it’s my fault we met Medusa.
Forget it,
You’re impossible.
You’re insufferable.
You’re—
Hey!
I’ll be back.
Percy,
What are you—
They’re not going to like that,
I am impertinent,
Come on,
We need a new plan.
Go ahead and sleep,
I’ll wake you if there’s trouble.
It makes me sad, Percy.
What does? The fact that you signed up for this stupid quest?
No. This makes me sad.
Oh, yeah. I guess you’d be an environmentalist.
Pam? Like the cooking spray?
Pan!
Tell me about the search,
The God of Wild Places disappeared two thousand years ago,
And you want to be a searcher.
It’s my life’s dream,
Oh, right, sorry.
Hang on—the first?
Not once in two thousand years?
No.
And your dad? You have no idea what happened to him?
None.
But you still want to go,
How are we going to get into the Underworld?
I don’t know,
Oh, I forgot. Annabeth will have a plan all figured out.
What do you mean?
Forgave you for what?
Wait a minute,
I can’t talk about it,
That’s not what I mean,
They seemed plenty aggressive to me.
Asking about me,
That doesn’t make sense.
Okay, Percy. Whatever.
How about I take first watch, huh? You get some sleep.
Well,
the zombie lives.
How long was I asleep?
Long enough for me to cook breakfast.
No, he’s not.
Are you…talking to that thing?
This thing,
is our ticket west. Be nice to him.
You can talk to animals?
Percy, meet Gladiola. Gladiola, Percy.
I’m not saying hello to a pink poodle,
Forget it.
Percy,
How does Gladiola know about the reward?
He read the signs,
Duh.
Of course,
Silly me.
So we turn in Gladiola,
we get money, and we buy tickets to Los Angeles. Simple.
Not another bus,
No,
Don’t worry,
Mortal police could never find us.
So,
Who wants your help?
What do you mean?
He offered my mother in trade. Who else could do that?
This time?
You mean you’ve run into them before?
What would you do if it was your dad?
That’s easy,
I’d leave him to rot.
You’re not serious?
My dad’s resented me since the day I was born, Percy,
But how…I mean, I guess you weren’t born in a hospital.…
My mom married a really awful guy,
He doesn’t care about me,
How old were you?
Same age as when I started camp. Seven.
I want to do that,
What?
Build something like that. You ever see the Parthenon, Percy?
Only in pictures.
You? An architect?
Sorry,
That was mean.
Can’t we work together a little?
I guess…the chariot,
Then we can cooperate, too. Right?
I suppose,
Food.
Come on, goat boy,
Sightseeing.
Sightseeing?
The Gateway Arch,
As long as there’s a snack bar without monsters.
Underground,
Guys,
You know the gods’ symbols of power?
Yeah?
Well, Hade—
Um, right,
You mean the Helm of Darkness,
He was there?
It allows him to become darkness,
But then…how do we know he’s not here right now, watching us?
We don’t,
Thanks, that makes me feel a lot better,
No parents?
They’re below,
Scared of heights.
Oh, the poor darlings.
Now, now, sonny. Behave.
Sonny. Is that his name?
No,
Next car, sir.
We’ll get out,
We’ll wait with you.
Naw, it’s okay. I’ll see you guys at the bottom.
Now, now, sonny,
Doggie!
Look, a doggie!
Well, son,
If you insist.
Chimera, dear,
Isn’t that a kind of anteater?
Hey, Chihuahua!
If you are the son of Poseidon,
You have no faith,
Die, faithless one,
Father, help me,
Um…thanks.
Thank you…Father.
Where are you?
Mom?
What?
But…
Who—how did you—
Gifts?
What gifts? Wait!
Mama! That boy walked out of the river.
That’s nice, dear,
But he’s dry!
That’s nice, dear.
…an adolescent boy,
Perrr-cy!
I sort of fell.
Percy! Six hundred and thirty feet?
Gangway!
Okay, ma’am,
There he is! That’s the boy!
What’s going on?
Whoa,
First things first,
We’ve got to get out of town!
Let’s try to contact Chiron,
We can’t use phones, right?
I’m not talking about phones.
What exactly are we doing?
It’s seventy-five cents,
Don’t look at me,
The dining car wiped me out.
Excellent,
What are you talking about?
I-M’ing.
Instant messaging?
Iris-messaging,
You summon the goddess with a spray gun?
Unless you know an easier way to make a rainbow.
Drachma, please.
O goddess, accept our offering.
Half-Blood Hill,
Luke!
Percy!
We’re…uh…fine,
He’s down at the cabins.
I’m right here,
What kind of issues?
Chiron had to—what’s that noise?
I’ll take care of it!
Grover, come on!
What?
But—
Give Percy the nozzle and come on!
Chiron had to break up a fight,
So what’s your status?
I wish I could be there,
But Chiron said the gods can’t take each other’s magic items directly.
That’s true,
Oh, hey,
You’d better go see what that was,
Oh…uh, yeah!
Really?
They fit and everything?
Well, take care of yourself out there in Denver,
Not much,
Come on, let’s find some dinner.
Well?
We, um, want to order dinner.
You kids have money to pay for it?
It’s on me.
So you’re old Seaweed’s kid, huh?
What’s it to you?
Percy, this is—
S’okay,
You’re Clarisse’s dad,
Ares, god of war.
That’s right, punk. I heard you broke Clarisse’s spear.
She was asking for it.
But, these aren’t…
Problem, sweetheart?
You can’t do that,
What favor could I do for a god?
Why don’t you go back and get it yourself ?
We’re not interested,
We’ve already got a quest.
You told him Hades stole the bolt?
Thanks,
We’re doing fine on our own.
My mom?
What interrupted your date?
Something scare you off ?
Not good,
Ares sought you out, Percy. This is not good.
It’s probably some kind of trick,
Forget Ares. Let’s just go.
We can’t,
Why does he need us?
Maybe it’s a problem that requires brains,
I’m afraid we’ll have to find out.
If Ares brings his girlfriend here for a date,
I’d hate to see what she looks like.
Percy,
Be more respectful.
Why? I thought you hated Ares.
He’s still a god. And his girlfriend is very temperamental.
You don’t want to insult her looks,
No, Aphrodite,
Goddess of love.
I thought she was married to somebody,
Hephaestus.
What’s your point?
Oh.
So how do we get in?
Maia!
You guys coming?
Clothes,
Fresh clothes.
Yeah,
But you can’t just—
Watch me.
What the heck.
So Ares and Aphrodite,
they have a thing going?
That’s old gossip, Percy,
What about Aphrodite’s husband?
Well, you know,
She likes bikers.
Whatever.
Hephaestus knows?
Oh sure,
Like that.
Guys, look.
This is too easy,
So we just walk down there and get it?
There’s a Greek letter carved here,
Eta. I wonder…
Grover,
you smell any monsters?
Nothing.
I told you, that was underground.
Okay, I’m sorry.
I’m going down there.
I’ll go with you.
No,
Sure. But what could go wrong?
I don’t know. Just a feeling. Annabeth, come with me—
Are you kidding?
What’s the problem now?
Who’s going to see you?
Fine,
I’ll do it myself.
What?
Just get the shield, Seaweed Brain, and let’s get out of here.
Wait,
Too late.
Guys!
We have to get out,
Duh!
Come on!
Live to Olympus in one minute…Fifty-nine seconds, fiftyeight…
Hephaestus!
Spiders!
Sp—sp—aaaah!
Thirty, twenty-nine,
Fifteen, fourteen,
Grover!
Get into that booth! Find the ‘on’ switch!
But—
Do it!
Five, four—
Two, one, zero!
Unfasten your seat belt,
Are you crazy?
Unless you want to get smashed to death.
We’re going to have to jump for it.
On my mark,
No! On my mark!
What?
Simple physics!
Force times the trajectory angle—
Fine!
On your mark!
Now!
Ouch!
You’re too heavy!
We’re going down!
Show’s over!
Thank you! Good night!
We need to have a little talk with Ares.
Well, well,
You didn’t get yourself killed.
You knew it was a trap,
You’re a jerk.
See that truck over there?
You’re kidding.
I don’t want your lousy—
Thank you, Lord Ares,
Thanks a lot.
You owe me one more thing,
You promised me information about my mother.
You sure you can handle the news?
She’s not dead.
What do you mean?
Kept. Why?
Nobody’s controlling me.
Oh yeah? See you around, kid.
That was not smart, Percy.
I don’t care.
You don’t want a god as your enemy. Especially not that god.
Hey, guys,
I hate to interrupt, but…
If we’re taking the zoo express,
we need to hurry.
This is kindness?
Humane zoo transport?
Hey,
That’s okay.
It’s just…
Spiders.
Because of the Arachne story,
We’re a team, remember?
I should’ve told you the truth from the beginning.
I thought if you knew what a failure I was, you wouldn’t want me along.
You were the satyr who tried to rescue Thalia, the daughter of Zeus.
That was you and Luke, wasn’t it?
I was supposed to escort Thalia to camp,
Stop it,
She sacrificed herself to save us,
Because you wouldn’t leave two other half-bloods behind?
That’s not fair.
Percy’s right,
You’re not lame,
Yeah,
How does he do that?
I don’t know,
I meant it.
That pine-tree bead,
Is that from your first year?
Yeah,
And the college ring is your father’s?
That’s none of your—
Yeah. Yeah, it is.
You don’t have to tell me.
No…it’s okay.
That doesn’t sound so bad.
You think you’ll ever try living with your dad again?
Please. I’m not into self-inflicted pain.
You shouldn’t give up,
Thanks for the advice,
So if the gods fight,
I don’t know what my mom will do. I just know I’ll fight next to you.
Why?
Because you’re my friend, Seaweed Brain. Any more stupid questions?
The truck’s stopped,
Hide!
Man!
I wish I hauled appliances.
You hot, big boy?
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
What do you want, Eddie?
What are you banging for?
What banging?
No kidding,
We’ve got to free them!
Hey! You need a permit for that!
Now would be a good time to leave,
The other animals first,
Good luck,
Will the animals be okay?
Don’t worry,
I placed a satyr’s sanctuary on them.
Meaning?
Meaning they’ll reach the wild safely,
Why can’t you place a blessing like that on us?
It only works on wild animals.
So it would only affect Percy,
Hey!
Kidding,
Come on. Let’s get out of this filthy truck.
Whoa.
Hey!
Welcome to the Lotus Casino. Here’s your room key.
Um, but…
No, no,
How much is on here?
What do you mean?
I mean, when does it run out of cash?
Oh, goodness,
This place is…
Sweet,
Absolutely sweet.
All those stations,
It’s interesting.
I feel good,
I love this place.
So what now?
Sleep?
Play time,
sick,
Hey, Darrin?
What?
What year is it?
In the game?
No. In real life.
1977.
No,
Really.
Hey, man. Bad vibes. I got a game happening.
Come on,
We’ve got to get out of here.
Annabeth?
What?
We need to leave.
Leave? What are you talking about? I’ve just got the towers—
This place is a trap.
What?
Listen. The Underworld. Our quest!
Oh, come on, Percy. Just a few more minutes.
So?
Can you imagine a better place?
Hey!
Oh my gods,
I don’t know, but we’ve got to find Grover.
Grover!
Die, human! Die, silly polluting nasty person!
Grover!
No! I just got to a new level! No!
We’re leaving,
Such a shame,
No, thanks.
Los Angeles, please.
You accept casino debit cards?
Swipe it,
Where to in Los Angeles…uh, Your Highness?
The Santa Monica Pier.
Your Highness
my lord
The Silent One?
Maybe…
That throne room sounds like Hades’s,
What?
Like what?
I—I don’t know,
But if I’d already retrieved the bolt,
To threaten Hades,
You have evil thoughts for a goat.
Why, thank you.
But the thing in the pit said it was waiting for two items,
You have an idea what might be in that pit, don’t you?
The answer is in the Underworld,
What now?
Percy?
What are you doing?
Percy Jackson.
You’ve come far, Percy Jackson. Well done.
And…you serve in Poseidon’s court?
If my father is so interested in me,
Do not judge the Lord of the Sea too harshly,
Even to their own children?
I know you journey to Hades’s realm,
Um…no, ma’am.
What will happen?
That,
What about the warning?
Wait!
At the river, you said not to trust the gifts. What gifts?
Good-bye, young hero,
You must listen to your heart.
No gift comes without a price.
They were free.
No.
You remind me of somebody I saw on TV,
Uh…I’m a stunt double…for a lot of child actors.
Oh! That explains it.
There you have it, America.
Who are the other children in this photo?
C’mon,
Hey, you.
Run!
There!
Crusty’s Water Bed Palace?
I think we lost them,
Lost who?
I’m Crusty,
Sorry to barge in,
We were just, um, browsing.
You mean hiding from those no-good kids,
This is my most popular model.
Million-hand massage,
Um,
I don’t think…
Million-hand massage!
Hmm,
Almost, almost.
Almost what?
But what—
Hey!
Ergo!
N-not c-c-cool!
N-not c-cool a-at all!
Almost, darn it.
Whoa, kid. Don’t worry. We’ll find you one in a sec.
Let my friends go.
Oh, sure I will. But I got to make them fit, first.
What do you mean?
Can’t stand imperfect measurements,
Ergo!
Don’t worry,
Percy!
Your real name’s not Crusty, is it?
Legally, it’s Procrustes,
The Stretcher,
Yeah,
You’re right. It’s got a good ring to it.
You think so?
Oh, absolutely,
Not too many.
That’s right!
Percy!
What are you doing?
Don’t mind her,
She’s impossible.
What do you do if they’re longer than six feet?
Oh, that happens all the time. It’s a simple fix.
Ah,
Sensible.
I’m so glad to come across an intelligent customer!
So, Crusty…
Absolutely. Try it out.
Guaranteed.
No way.
Way.
Show me.
No waves. See?
Ergo.
Hey!
Center him just right,
No!
Wait! This is just a demo.
A few simple adjustments…
You drive a hard bargain,
I think I’ll start with the top.
No money down! No interest for six months!
You look taller,
Very funny,
Be faster next time.
Come on,
Give us a minute,
Then you’re ready for the Underworld,
Okay. You remember the plan.
The plan,
Yeah. I love the plan.
What happens if the plan doesn’t work?
Don’t think negative.
Right,
Oh, right!
What a precious young lad.
N-no.
Sir,
Sir,
Charon.
Amazing! Now: Mr. Charon.
Mr. Charon,
Well done.
I hate being confused with that old horseman. And now, how may I help you little dead ones?
We want to go the Underworld,
Well, that’s refreshing.
It is?
How did you die, then?
Oh,
Um…drowned…in the bathtub.
All three of you?
Big bathtub.
Oh, but we have coins.
Well, now…
Here now,
No,
I’m dead.
We have to get to the Underworld,
Leave while you can,
No service, no tip.
It’s a shame, too,
We had more to offer.
A lot,
You deserve better,
Come along.
Freeloaders.
Right. Now, no one get any ideas while I’m gone,
What happens to the spirits waiting in the lobby?
Nothing,
For how long?
Forever, or until I’m feeling generous.
Oh,
That’s…fair.
We’ll get out alive,
Ha.
Well?
Nothing,
I think I’m getting seasick.
The River Styx,
It’s so…
Polluted,
Old Three-Face is hungry,
Bad luck for you, godlings.
What do you figure?
The fast line must go straight to the Asphodel Fields,
There’s a court for dead people?
And do what?
Imagine standing in a wheat field in Kansas. Forever.
Harsh,
Not as harsh as that,
Look.
He’s that preacher who made the news, remember?
Oh, yeah.
Lamborghini for the Lord
What’re they doing to him?
Special punishment from Hades,
But if he’s a preacher,
and he believes in a different hell.…
He’s a Rottweiler.
I’m starting to see him better,
Why is that?
I think…
It can smell the living,
But that’s okay,
Right,
A plan.
Can you understand it?
Oh yeah,
I can understand it.
What’s it saying?
I don’t think humans have a four-letter word that translates, exactly.
Hey, Big Fella,
I bet they don’t play with you much.
GROWWWLLLL!
Good boy,
Fetch!
Um,
Percy?
Yeah?
I just thought you’d want to know.
Yeah?
Wait!
Five seconds,
Do we run now?
See the ball? You want the ball, Cerberus? Sit!
Sit!
Good boy!
Drop it!
Good boy.
Go now. EZ DEATH line—it’s faster.
But—
Now!
Stay!
If you want the ball, stay!
What about you?
I know what I’m doing, Percy,
Good dog!
How did you do that?
Obedience school,
Never mind that,
Come on!
Good boy,
I’ll bring you another ball soon,
Good dog. I’ll come visit you soon. I—I promise.
Let’s go.
Well, Percy, what have we learned today?
That three-headed dogs prefer red rubber balls over sticks?
No,
We’ve learned that your plans really, really bite!
That’s what it’s all about,
That’s the place for heroes.
I suppose it’s too late to turn back,
We’ll be okay.
Maybe we should search some of the other places first,
Like, Elysium, for instance…
Come on, goat boy.
Grover,
Stop messing around.
But I didn’t—
Maia!
Untie the shoes!
Grover!
Hold on to something!
What?
Come on, Percy!
But that’s—
I know!
I don’t know how…
I didn’t…
Wait,
Listen.
Percy, this place—
Shh.
Wh—what’s that noise?
Magic,
We have to get out of here,
What was that?
One of Hades’s pets?
Let’s keep going.
Can you walk?
Yeah, sure. I never liked those shoes, anyway.
The garden of Persephone,
Keep walking.
You know,
Well, guys,
I suppose we should…knock?
I guess that means entrez-vous,
You are brave to come here, Son of Poseidon,
Only two requests?
Lord Hades,
Really bad,
Return Zeus’s master bolt to me,
Um…Uncle,
Do you think I want war, godling?
You are the Lord of the Dead,
Well…
More security ghouls,
Charon wants a pay raise,
Don’t get me started on Charon!
But you took Zeus’s master bolt.
Lies!
His plan?
You were the thief on the winter solstice,
But…
Lord Hades, your helm of darkness is missing, too?
No!
Poseidon didn’t—I didn’t—
I have said nothing of the helm’s disappearance,
You didn’t try to stop us? But—
Return my helm now, or I will stop death,
You’re as bad as Zeus,
Of course,
And the other monsters?
Easily?
Return my property!
But I don’t have your helm. I came for the master bolt.
Which you already possess!
But I didn’t!
Open your pack, then.
Percy,
How—
I—I don’t know. I don’t understand.
You heroes are always the same,
Lord Hades, wait,
This is all a mistake.
A mistake?
There is no mistake,
Yes,
Ah, the pearls,
Only three,
We were tricked,
Set up.
Yes, but why?
And the voice in the pit—
I don’t know yet,
But I intend to ask.
Decide, boy!
Percy.
I know that.
Leave me here,
Use the third pearl on your mom.
No!
I’m a satyr,
No.
No way,
I’m staying behind.
Think again, goat boy,
Stop it, both of you!
I know what to do,
Take these.
But, Percy…
I’m sorry,
I’ll be back. I’ll find a way.
Godling…?
I’ll find your helm, Uncle,
Do not defy me—
Percy Jackson, you will not—
Now, guys!
Destroy them!
Look up!
We’re going to crash!
How do you control these things?
I don’t think you do!
Dude!
Beat it.
I don’t believe it,
We went all that way—
It was a trick,
A strategy worthy of Athena.
Hey,
You get it, don’t you?
Yeah. I get it.
Well, I don’t!
Would somebody—
Percy…
I’m sorry about your mother. I’m so sorry.…
The prophecy was right,
Gee, let me think.
Hey, kid,
You tricked me,
You stole the helm and the master bolt.
Who did you use? Clarisse? She was there at the winter solstice.
The helm of darkness,
Exactly,
But they’re your family!
You gave me the backpack in Denver,
Yes and no,
Anyway,
But why not just keep the master bolt for yourself ?
You’re lying,
Of course it was!
You didn’t order the theft,
I am the god of war! I take orders from no one! I don’t have dreams!
Who said anything about dreams?
Fight me yourself, Ares.
Scared?
In your adolescent dreams.
Percy, run!
Wave!
Are you going to fight me now?
Watch it, kid. I could turn you into—
A cockroach,
That’s cool, dead boy,
Classic it is.
Percy,
Don’t do this. He’s a god.
He’s a coward,
Wear this, at least. For luck.
Reconciliation,
Athena and Poseidon together.
Thanks.
And take this,
Grover…I don’t know what to say.
You all done saying good-bye?
Not bad, not bad.
Percy!
Cops!
There, officer!
See?
Looks like that kid on TV…what the heck…
That guy’s armed,
Call for backup.
Admit it, kid,
You got no hope. I’m just toying with you.
This is a private matter!
Be gone!
You have made an enemy, godling,
Percy!
Don’t watch!
We saw the whole thing,
So…it truly was not you?
Return that to Lord Hades,
Percy…
That was so incredibly…
Terrifying,
Cool!
Did you guys feel that…whatever it was?
Must’ve been the Furies overhead,
We have to get back to New York,
By tonight.
That’s impossible,
unless we—
Fly,
Yeah,
Pretty much exactly like that. Come on.
Why didn’t I remember him before?
All I want,
Six hundredth floor.
No such floor, kiddo.
I need an audience with Zeus.
Sorry?
You heard me.
Oh, I think he’ll make an exception.
That isn’t…
Yes, it is,
You want me take it out and—
No! No!
Raindrops keep falling on my head.…
Father.
Peace, brother,
The boy defers to his father. This is only right.
You still claim him then?
I have admitted my wrongdoing,
I have spared him once already,
And risk destroying your own master bolt?
Let us hear him out, brother.
I shall listen,
Perseus,
Look at me.
Address Lord Zeus, boy,
Tell him your story.
I sense the boy tells the truth,
He is proud and impulsive,
It runs in the family.
Lord?
Yes?
In the dreams,
You are accusing Hades, after all?
No,
I had help, sir,
Grover Underwood and Annabeth Chase—
Um…thank you, sir.
Your uncle,
Sir,
what was in that pit?
Have you not guessed?
Kronos,
The king of the Titans.
He’s healing,
He’s coming back.
That’s what he intends, Father. That’s what he said.
But—
No…sir.
You must go, child. But first, know that your mother has returned.
My mother?
Do you…would you…
A package?
Your mother is a queen among women,
I don’t mind, Father.
Not yet, perhaps,
I’ll leave you then.
I—I won’t bother you again.
Perseus.
Percy! Oh, thank goodness. Oh, my baby.
Hey, Sally! That meat loaf done yet or what?
Oh, yeah. About that…
He’s not a fugitive after all,
Bad enough I had to give back your life insurance money, Sally,
Get me the phone. I’ll call the cops.
Gabe, no!
But—
Hey, Gabe,
He’s just a kid.
I’ll be nice to you, punk.
Gabe!
He ran away,
Let him stay gone.
Gabe is just upset, honey,
Mom, it’ll never work out. Not as long as Gabe’s here.
Mom.
I’m trying, Percy. I just…I need some time.
Mom, do you want Gabe gone?
Percy, it isn’t that simple. I—
I can do it,
You can’t.
Poseidon called you a queen,
Percy—
You sound so much like your father,
What’s wrong with that?
I’ll leave the box,
If he threatens you…
Where will you go, Percy?
Half-Blood Hill.
For the summer…or forever?
I guess that depends.
Leaving so soon, punk?
Good riddance.
Hey, Sally,
What about that meat loaf, huh?
The meat loaf is coming right up, dear,
I’m off,
I just came to say…well, you know.
Kind of a secret,
We understand,
You got enough tin cans for the trip?
Yeah.
And you remembered your reed pipes?
Jeez, Annabeth,
You’re like an old mama goat.
Well,
wish me luck.
Hey, Grover,
Wherever you’re going—I hope they make good enchiladas.
We’ll see him again,
The choice was unanimous,
Percy.
Um, sorry,
I just—
It’s okay,
Those dummies won’t be bothering anybody anymore.
We build new ones every summer.
Oh, this? New toy. This is Backbiter.
Backbiter?
I didn’t know they could make weapons like that.
They probably can’t,
It’s one of a kind.
You think it’s a good idea?
I mean—
Aw, come on.
Drinks are on me.
Sure,
Why not?
You miss being on a quest?
With monsters attacking me every three feet? Are you kidding?
Yeah, I miss it,
You?
I’ve lived at Half-Blood Hill year-round since I was fourteen,
The heck with laurel wreaths,
You make it sound like you’re leaving.
I wouldn’t,
Luke, what—
You,
I saw a lot out there in the world, Percy,
Luke…you’re talking about our parents,
You’re as crazy as Ares.
Kronos,
That’s who you serve.
You should be careful with names,
He’s brainwashing you, Luke.
That’s not an easy quest,
Hercules did it.
Exactly,
You summoned the hellhound, that night in the forest.
The flying shoes were cursed,
Thalia gave her life to save you,
Don’t speak of Thalia!
You’re being used, Luke. You and Ares both. Don’t listen to Kronos.
I’ve been used?
Call off the bug,
If you’re so strong, fight me yourself.
Luke—
Help,
Please…
Here we are again,
You idiot,
Now, now,
How are you feeling?
Like my insides have been frozen, then microwaved.
I can’t believe that Luke…
This must be reported to Olympus,
Luke is out there right now,
I have to go after him.
No, Percy. The gods—
Won’t even talk about Kronos,
Percy, it isn’t my place—
You’ve been ordered not to talk to me about it, haven’t you?
All right!
Fine!
We can’t just sit back and do nothing,
We will not sit back,
Assuming I live that long.
I’ll be back as soon as I can,
Who’s here?
What’s wrong?
Nothing.
Yeah. Help me up. I want to go outside.
Percy, that isn’t a good idea.
I told you…
I’m fine,
What are you going to do?
I don’t know.
You mean, to your dad’s?
I wrote him a letter when we got back,
That took guts.
When I get back next summer,
Sounds like a plan worthy of Athena.
Take care, Seaweed Brain,
Keep your eyes open.
You too, Wise Girl.
I’ll be back next summer,
MIIIIINE!
Come on, dear,
Coming,
Percy, are you all right?
Yeah…fine.
School, or…
I think Grover’s in trouble,
I wouldn’t be too worried, dear,
What is it?
Nothing,
Wait a minute,
Usually, dear. But with the problems they’re having—
What problems?
But—
Percy, we’ll talk this afternoon. Go on to school.
Who’s after me?
Not sure.
Where’d you see these people with the flyers?
That makes no sense. Who—
I don’t know, kid, but I gotta go.
I appreciate it,
I’ll be fine.
Why?
They’re coming.
Unbelievable,
I want to strangle him.
But two years?
I can’t explain Randolph’s actions. I never could, Annabeth.
—to find Magnus,
How do we even know Magnus is alive?
Missing for two years? He could be frozen in a ditch somewhere!
Randolph is sure,
