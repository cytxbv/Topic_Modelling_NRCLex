Oh, pull up right there!
So.
About that invitation.
Oh . . . right.
on call
Percy,
I know the timing is bad. But it's always bad for you, right?
I really want to go,
It's just—
The war.
Is he giving you a hard time?
The school where your mom went?
Save the Endangered Yellow-bellied Sapsucker
He thinks if he does a bunch of nice stuff for me, I'll feel guilty and give in.
Which is why he agreed to let me come with you guys on vacation?
Something you want to talk about?
Okay,
Just a normal afternoon and two normal people.
Oh . . .
Um . . .
Blackjack,
What are you—
 'Sup, Percy.
Time?
Hi.
Oh, hey. I'm Beckendorf. You must be Rachel. Percy's told me . . . uh, I mean he mentioned you.
Really? Good.
So I guess you guys have to go save the world now.
Pretty much,
Would you tell my mom—
I'll tell her. I'm sure she's used to it. And I'll explain to Paul about the hood.
Good luck.
So,
I'm guessing you don't want me to mention that little scene to Annabeth.
Oh, gods,
Don't even think about it.
You know what to do?
Blackjack,
set us down on the lowest stern deck.
Don't wait for us,
Trust me,
We'll get out by ourselves.
We'll make it back to camp,
You bet,
Let's go blow Kronos back into a million pieces.
I don't care what your nose says!
Meat loaf sandwiches are good!
Bah, your brain isn't on board!
engine room.
One down,
About five thousand to go.
Slap that one on the console,
I'll get the turbines.
How much longer?
Too long.
I'll distract them,
Meet you at the rendezvous point.
Percy—
Wish me luck.
Good luck,
giant
FFFFffffff,
Hey, crabby.
I'm just gonna scoot around you so—
There!
Intruder!
AHHHHHHH!
What isss thisss?
A prize for Kronosss!
Get him!
Kronos!
If you want to live,
get off this ship now. Tell the other demigods.
You're late, Percy.
We've been expecting you for days.
Come, bow before me.
Yeah, that'll happen,
Come forward,
If you dare.
Luke had a big head,
A shame to kill you now,
You'll never get this boat to Manhattan.
And why would that be?
Nakamura!
Success, my lord,
We found him just as we were told.
No!
We found him amidships,
Soon.
Are you sure he didn't set the explosives?
He was going toward the engine room, my lord.
How do you know that?
Er . . .
Open his bag,
Did you, perhaps,
capture this demigod near the galley?
Um—
And did you, perhaps, send someone to actually CHECK THE ENGINE ROOM?
Quite an explosion,
It doesn't matter,
The gods have answered the challenge. Soon they will be destroyed.
I will go east to marshal our forces,
Quiet!
And if you need more warriors?
Oh, sure,
He gets to erupt into flames. I get to wear these stupid ram's horns.
You see, Percy?
Percy?
Beckendorf?
No, brother.
Tyson?
Yay! Your brain works!
Where—
Daddy's palace,
How long—
We found you last night,
sinking through the water.
The Princess Andromeda?
Went ka-boom,
Beckendorf was on board. Did you find . . .
No sign of him. I am sorry, brother.
What was that?
Daddy will explain. Come, he is blowing up monsters.
Daddy,
He did that?
Have you been in the fight?
I have been . . . fixing weapons,
Come. Let's go find Daddy.
Delphin,
Dad?
Hello, Percy.
What—what happened to you?
It's all right, Tyson,
Percy, excuse my appearance. The war has been hard on me.
But you're immortal,
You can look . . . any way you want.
I reflect the state of my realm,
Yes, well . . . and this is my son Triton. Er, my other son.
Your son and heir,
Hello, Perseus Jackson. Come to help at last?
Tell me what to do,
I will see to the front line, Father. Don't worry. I will not fail.
I'm sorry about that,
My family is anxious,
Oceanus,
The Titan of the sea?
He looks stupid,
I mean, who fights with a snake?
Daddy will tie it in knots,
Briares!
He fights well,
I wish we had a whole army like him, but he is the only one.
Percy, we may not have much time,
Tell me of your mission. Did you see Kronos?
But we didn't kill him, did we?
No,
But you've bought our side some time.
There were demigods on that ship,
They were brainwashed!
Percy,
The bigger threat?
Return to camp? But you're in trouble here. I want to help!
You can't, Percy. Your job is elsewhere.
Daddy . . . Percy can fight with a sword. He is good.
I know that,
Dad, I can help,
I know I can. You're not going to hold out here much longer.
Return to camp,
And tell Chiron it is time.
For what?
You must hear the prophecy. The entire prophecy.
Great Prophecy
What if this is the decision?
Staying here to light, or leaving? What if I leave and you . . .
Percy, you must go,
I will miss you, brother!
I will go,
You should let him fight,
He hates being stuck in the armory. Can't you tell?
You should trust him,
Not try to protect him.
Oceanus approaches,
I must meet him in battle.
I will hold,
spend it,
The time is coming,
I must assume my true godly form,
Go—and good luck, my son.
Good-bye, Father,
Percy!
What happened? Where's Beckendorf?
Percy!
Thank the gods. But where . . .
What happened?
Is Luke—
The ship blew up,
He wasn't destroyed. I don't know where—
Where's Charlie?
Silena, my dear, let's talk about this at the Big House—
No,
No. No.
Come on, girl,
Let's get to the Big House. I'll make you some hot chocolate.
I'm glad you're not dead, Seaweed Brain.
Thanks,
Me too.
Poseidon mentioned another threat,
We will discuss that also,
One more thing.
You know where it is,
Bring it down, please.
Come on, Percy.
You remember Briares throwing those boulders?
And Grover causing a Panic?
Prophecy.
Right.
Prophecy.
Great Prophecy.
I never understood this,
What?
Why it's a mummy.
 Annabeth pointed at the mummy. 
What happened?
So what now?
No way,
The time wasn't right,
Great,
Can I read it now?
Downstairs at the war council,
Not in front of . . . you know.
Maimer.
Lamer.
It's our loot!
STOP IT!
What are you guys doing?
Tell Michael not to be a selfish jerk.
Oh, that's perfect, coming from you,
The only reason I'm here is to support Silena!
What are you talking about?
It's been wonderful,
What issue?
You're in charge, right? Does my cabin get what we want or not?
Sure,
That would be nice,
Maybe I should ask Mr. D—
As you know,
I see,
And the senior counselors? Are any of you going to side with me?
Fine.
Good riddance.
Are you kidding?
This is a disaster!
She can't be serious,
Can she?
Her pride has been wounded. She'll calm down eventually.
Now,
A half-blood of the eldest dogs . . .
Er, Percy?
That's gods. Not dogs.
Oh, right,
Percy,
Read the rest.
Preserve,
It means to save.
I know what it means,
Olympus to preserve or raze.
Raise is good, isn't it?
Not raise,
Obliterate,
Annihilate. Turn to rubble.
Got it.
Thanks.
Without realizing I was going to die in the end anyway?
Yeah, I get it.
Percy,
Sure,
A single choice shall end his days. That has tons of meanings, right?
Maybe we can stop it,
Perhaps we should let Percy think about these lines,
He needs time—
No.
I don't need time. If I die, I die. I can't worry about that, right?
Let's move on,
We've got other problems. We've got a spy.
A spy?
Well,
Um, I mean, it could be anybody.
Yes.
Like one of Luke's siblings.
Stop!
She's right,
No indeed,
In fact his next assault is already on the way.
You mean the 'bigger threat' Poseidon mentioned?
Percy,
Tell me what's happened,
—even larger than last year's eruption, and geologists warn that the mountain may not be done.
It's him,
Typhon.
Monumental floods,
Are those . . . the gods?
Yes, Percy,
How long until he gets here?
But then who's guarding Olympus?
If Typhon gets to New York, it won't matter who's guarding Olympus.
It's a trick,
We have to warn the gods. Something else is going to happen.
Something worse than Typhon? I hope not.
We have to defend Olympus,
Kronos has another attack planned.
He did,
But you sunk his ship.
Maybe you're right,
Well,
I think that's enough for one night.
That's an understatement,
room
Demigods,
And their stupid quests.
Rachel!
What in the world are you doing? Turn off that—
Come in!
WD
What is going on?
It's three in the morning.
Couldn't sleep,
So . . . I take it your friend isn't coming to St. Thomas?
I don't know.
We leave in the morning,
If he hasn't made up his mind yet—
He's probably not coming,
Happy?
Are you still having bad dreams?
Headaches?
I should never have told you about that.
I'm your father,
I'm worried about you.
Worried about the family's reputation,
We could call Dr. Arkwright,
He helped you get through the death of your hamster.
I was six then,
And no, Dad, I don't need a therapist. I just . . .
It will be good for you to get away,
You've had some unhealthy influences.
I'm not going to Clarion Ladies Academy,
Try to get some sleep,
We'll be at the beach by tomorrow night. It will be fun.
Fun,
Lots of fun.
I hope they're dreams,
Percy,
what is going on?
Hey, let me borrow your phone so I can call Rachel!
You're being generous.
Hey, give me a break. I don't have Tyson cleaning up after me this summer.
Three out of five,
Great job as usual, Silena,
You want a bonbon?
Are they any good?
They taste like cardboard.
What are they fighting about anyway?
That flying chariot.
What?
You asked what they were fighting about.
Oh. Oh, right.
We're fighting for our lives,
and they're bickering about some stupid chariot.
They'll get over it,
Clarisse will come to her senses.
Vlacas,
We'll wait outside while you finish inspection.
So . . . get any good info from that thing?
Too much,
Yeah,
That would be fun.
You know . . .
Urn, yeah,
Like . . . is everything cool with your family?
My dad wanted to take me to Greece this summer,
I've always wanted to see—
The Parthenon,
Yeah.
That's okay. There'll be other summers, right?
Three out five,
 'Dear Grover,'
You haven't heard anything from him? Even with your empathy link?
Annabeth.
What do you want me to say?
I'd use Typhon as a distraction. Then I'd hit Olympus directly, while the gods were in the West.
Just like in Rachel's picture.
Percy,
Rachel is just a mortal.
We'll just have to be ready.
How?
I knew we shouldn't have shown you the prophecy.
All it did was scare you. You run away from things when you're scared.
Me? Run away?
Yes, you. You're a coward, Percy Jackson!
If you don't like our chances,
maybe you should go on that vacation with Rachel.
Annabeth—
If you don't like our company.
That's not fair!
Hey, Silena, I'm really sorry.
Good work, Percy,
No, it's all right,
Thank . . . thank you, Percy. I should go.
You want company?
She's stronger than she looks,
She'll survive.
You could help with that,
Not my problem,
My cabin doesn't get honor, I don't fight.
All right,
So, what—you're just going to let Kronos crush us?
If you want my help so bad, tell Apollo to give us the chariot.
You're such a big baby.
Whoa, guys,
Not you too!
Hey, wait! I just meant—Clarisse, wait!
WOOF!
Ow!
Hey, girl. Good to see you too. Ow!
 He waved his arms and trotted on his hooves as if the grass were hot. 
Sorry, Leneus,
That's your name, right?
WOOF!
Make it go away! Juniper, I will not help you under these circumstances!
Percy,
I told you!
You are better off without that traitor.
WOOF!
I . . . I won't answer questions with this hellhound sniffing my tail!
I'll walk the dog,
You tried to vote him into exile,
Chiron and Dionysus stopped you.
Bah! They are honorary Council members. It wasn't a proper vote.
I'll tell Dionysus you said that.
I only meant . . . Now see here, Jackson. This is none of your business.
Grover's my friend,
No! Grover's a liar and good riddance. We're better off without him.
Maron and Silenus . . . I . . . I'm sure they'll be back,
It's going to get a lot more unsettling,
I'm telling you, I've heard nothing. Perhaps he's dead.
He's not dead,
I can feel that much.
Empathy links,
Very unreliable.
So ask around,
Without my permission! And it's not our war.
No problem,
I've got worse enemies than overweight satyrs.
He scared us to death!
But if you do hear anything?
Anything at all?
Uh, you bet. I'll keep my ears open.
We'll find him, Juniper,
Oh, no you don't! I know about dogs and trees. I'm gone!
How did you—
I talked to his ghost.
Oh . . . right.
Did he say anything?
He doesn't blame you. He figured you'd be beating yourself up, and he said you shouldn't.
Is he going to try for rebirth?
I had a vision you were on Mount Tarn,
Was that—
Real,
I didn't mean to be spying on the Titans, but I was in the neighborhood.
Doing what?
Following a lead on . . . you know, my family.
So how did it go?
Any luck?
No,
But I may have a new lead soon.
What's the lead?
That's not important right now. You know why I'm here.
Nico, I don't know,
It seems pretty extreme.
They're no match for the Titan army,
We can give you the same power,
You can't prevent a prophecy,
But you can fight it.
You can become invincible.
Maybe we should wait. Try to fight without—
No!
It has to be now!
Urn, you sure you're okay?
All right,
What do we do first?
I'll explain when we get there,
Luke ran away when he was really young,
I didn't think his mom was alive.
Oh, she's alive.
Okay . . .
So how do we get to Connecticut? I can call Blackjack—
No.
Pegasi don't like me, and the feeling is mutual. But there's no need for flying.
Your friend here can help.
You haven't tried shadow travel yet?
Shadow travel?
Hop on board,
This will make her very tired,
I don't understand,
No,
You're not coming?
Don't worry,
I'll meet you there.
I'm okay,
How did you do that?
Practice. A few times running into walls. A few accidental trips to China.
Are you going to take a nap too?
So we've got some quality time in Connecticut.
What now?
We ring the doorbell,
Ready?
Luke!
Oh, my dear boy!
Luke!
Come in!
I have your lunch ready!
This way, my dear!
Urn, Ms. Castellan?
Mm?
We need to ask you about your son.
Oh, yes! They told me he would never come back. But I knew better.
When did you last see him?
He was so young when he left,
 Then she looked at me and smiled. 
Ma'am,
What, uh . . . what happened to your eyes?
The Mist?
Yes, dear.
What sort of job?
What happened?
Luke was so kind,
Do they, Mrs. Medusa? No, no threat at all.
Ms. Castellan,
Mom,
Um, yeah. Have you seen Luke since he left home?
Well, of course!
When?
When did Luke visit you last?
Well, it was . . . Oh goodness . . .
His eyes,
Were they gold?
Gold?
No. How silly. Luke has blue eyes. Beautiful blue eyes!
Ms. Castellan?
My—my blessing. Isn't that sweet?
Thank you, ma'am. That's all the information we—
Ms. Castellan?
AHHHH,
My child,
Ms. C?
Are you okay?
Well, of course, dear. I'm fine. Why do you ask?
Ms. C, you were telling us something,
Something about your son.
Was I?
We have to go,
We'll tell Luke . . . uh, we'll tell him you said hello.
But you can't leave!
Hermes will be here soon,
He'll want to see his boy!
Maybe next time,
Thank you for—
Thanks for everything.
Luke, at least be safe. Promise me you'll be safe.
I will . . . Mom.
You hear that? He will be safe. I told you he would be!
Hello,
Hello again, Lady.
Sit, Percy Jackson,
For the gods,
Thank you. As tender of the flame, I get a share of every sacrifice, you know.
I recognize you now,
You did not stop to talk,
You're Hestia,
Goddess of the Hearth.
My lady,
why aren't you with the other Olympians, fighting Typhon?
I'm not much for fighting.
Besides,
someone has to keep the home fires burning while the other gods are away.
So you're guarding Mount Olympus?
That was great,
Thank you, Hestia.
Did you have a good visit with May Castellan?
What's wrong with her, exactly?
She was born with a gift,
She could see through the Mist.
Like my mother,
But the glowing eyes thing—
Some bear the curse of sight better than others,
One minute she was all happy,
No wonder Luke ran away,
It's easy to judge others,
But will you follow Luke's path? Seek the same powers?
We have no choice, my lady. It's the only way Percy stands a chance.
Mmm.
Not all powers are spectacular.
Uh-huh,
It unbalanced the Council,
Suddenly there were seven guys and five girls.
I don't know what you mean.
Perhaps not yet. But soon. Will you continue your quest?
Is that why you're here—to warn me against going?
Who put this wall of fur in the doorway?
Percy?
Are you here? Are you all right?
I'm here!
WOOF!
So it's true.
Sorry about Mrs. O'Leary,
destroying the living room and all.
Thanks for not freaking out,
Oh, I'm freaking out,
I just think it's awesome!
Yeah, well,
you may not be so excited when you hear what's happening.
Percy, it's dangerous,
Even for you.
Mom, I know. I could die. Nico explained that. But if we don't try—
We'll all die,
An invasion of New York?
I don't know,
Ms. Jackson,
You want me to bless this?
It's crazy. Percy, please—
Mom, I can't do it without you.
And if you survive this . . . this process?
Then I go to war,
Me against Kronos. And only one of us will survive.
You're my son,
I can't just . . .
Sally.
Percy,
I give you my blessing.
It's time.
Percy,
Mom,
you know demigods and phones—
I know,
Like Theseus,
Except he forgot,
What about a flag or a flare?
From Olympus—the Empire State Building.
Something blue,
Yes,
I'll watch for a blue signal. And I'll try to avoid jumping off palace roofs.
Sorry, girl,
Shadow travel time again.
Where now?
Los Angeles?
No need,
There's a closer entrance to the Underworld.
It's okay. She just smells the way home.
Through the rocks?
The Underworld has two major entrances,
You know the one in L.A.
Charon's ferry.
The dude with the harp.
Dude with the lyre,
and-so-they-died/the-end
So this is the Door of Orpheus.
How does it open?
We need music,
How's your singing?
Um, no. Can't you just, like, tell it to open? You're the son of Hades and all.
It's not so easy. We need music.
I have a better idea.
GROVER!
It's no good,
What happened?
I got through. He's . . . yeah. He's on his way.
Grover!
Woof!
Blah-haa-haa!
You okay, man?
Oh, I'm fine.
Good to see you, G-man,
You remember Nico.
Perrrrcy!
I was worried,
Where've you been the last two months?
The last two—
The last two months? What are you talking about?
We haven't heard from you,
Juniper's worried. We sent Iris-messages, but—
Hold on.
August.
That's impossible. It's June. I just lay down to take a nap and . . .
I remember now! He knocked me out. Percy, we have to stop him!
Whoa,
Slow down. Tell me what happened.
You can sense stuff like that?
Like a mirage?
Yes,
And whenever he passed humans—
The humans would pass out,
Curl up and go to sleep.
You know this guy in black?
Afraid so,
Grover, what happened?
Grover, you met Morpheus, the God of Dreams. You're lucky you ever woke up.
Two months,
He put me to sleep for two months!
Why didn't the nymphs try to wake you?
We've got to figure out what Morpheus was doing in the park,
He's working for Kronos,
Wait,
What plan?
You're not serious,
Not the Underworld again.
I'm not asking you to come, man,
Please, man,
It would mean a lot. For old times' sake?
As I recall, in the old times we almost died a lot. But okay, here goes nothing.
Thanks . . . I think.
Perrrrcy, is Kronos really going to invade?
I wish I could tell you better, but yeah. He will.
Better tell Juniper you're okay, too.
Juniper! Oh, she's going to kill me!
Ready?
It'll be fine. Don't worry.
You okay?
Fine.
Just keep moving,
courage
Um, maybe later, girl.
We have to go inside the gates first,
But the river's right here.
I have to get something,
It's the only way.
Woof!
Mrs. O'Leary, no!
Don't sniff . . . Oh, man.
Come on. They won't give us any trouble in the line. You're with me.
Hey,
we're inside the gates already. Where are we—
Mrs. Dodds,
Welcome back, honey.
You know Alecto?
If you mean the hag in the middle, yeah,
She was my math teacher.
Wait a second, Nico. What do you—
You tricked me?
Oh, don't struggle, honey,
I'd hate to drop you.
Tell Mrs. O'Leary to behave,
I don't want her to get hurt, Percy. My father is waiting. He just wants to talk.
Mrs. O'Leary, down! It's okay, girl.
All right, traitor,
You've got your prize. Take me to the stupid palace.
—told you he was a bum!
Mother!
We have visitors!
Please!
Percy Jackson,
At last.
Hmmph,
Demigods. Just what we need.
Father,
I have done as you asked.
Took you long enough,
Your sister would've done a better job.
What do you want, Hades?
To talk, of course.
Didn't Nico tell you?
So this whole quest was a lie. Nico brought me down here to get me killed.
Oh, no,
Father,
Can we please not talk about that woman in my presence?
I'm sorry, my dove,
I had to promise the boy something.
Mother—
And get stuck in the Underworld!
Mother, please—
DEMETER!
That is enough. You are a guest in my house.
Oh, a house is it?
I told you,
Excuse me,
But if you're going to kill me, could you just get on with it?
Well, this one has an attitude,
Indeed,
I'd love to kill him.
Father!
You promised!
Husband, we talked about this,
Father, you promised!
 He glanced uncomfortably at Persephone. 
That's why you hid us in the Lotus Casino?
But what happened to our mother? Why don't I remember her?
Not important,
You would do well to listen more and talk less, boy. As for the lawyer . . .
You!
I do lawyers and teachers very well!
But why did you free us from the casino?
You know why,
 I said. 
Waiting things out,
And when Kronos comes after you?
Let him try. He'll be weakened. And my son here, Nico—
You're crazy,
Kronos will crush you, right after he finishes pulverizing Olympus.
No!
Father, that wasn't our agreement. And you haven't told me everything!
I've told you all you need to know,
That boy needs to eat more,
He's too skinny. He needs more cereal.
No, my dear. I've spared his life. That's enough.
Fine. What's for breakfast? I'm starving.
Cereal,
Mother!
Don't feel too bad, Percy Jackson,
What trap?
If you know about it, do something! At least let me tell the other gods!
Thankfully, the building had been abandoned for demolition,
Percy!
Want . . . to . . . rescue,
Oh, yeah? And why should I trust you?
No . . . choice?
We have to get out of here,
Why?
Does your dad want to talk to me again?
Percy, I swear on the River Styx, I didn't know what he was planning.
You know what your dad is like!
He tricked me. He promised—
Come on.
Alarms,
What do we do?
How about . . . run?
WOOOOOF!
Good girl.'
Can you give us a ride to the Styx?
Uh,
Better.
Your powers drain you too much,
With great power . . . comes great need to take a nap. Wake me up later.
Whoa, zombie dude.
My father will be coming soon,
We should hurry.
So . . . I just jump in?
You have to prepare yourself first,
Sounds fun,
This is no joke,
Achilles,
I warned the other one not to follow my path. Now I will warn you.
Luke? You spoke with Luke?
Do not do this,
You mean I'll have a bad heel?
I have to,
Otherwise I don't stand a chance.
I don't suppose you could tell me Luke's mortal point?
Percy,
maybe he's right.
This was your idea.
I know, but now that we're here—
Percy,
I give you my blessing.
Be safe, brother!
Enchiladas!
Hold on, Seaweed Brain.
You are such an idiot sometimes.
Come on. Take my hand.
Are you okay?
Your skin. Oh, gods. You're hurt!
I'm fine . . . I think.
Do you feel stronger?
THERE!
You will not escape me this time, Percy Jackson!
Destroy him!
Father, no!
Now, Jackson, listen here. . . .
Just because I'm a nice person,
I'll let you go. But first, tell me about that trap!
You just . . . with a sword . . . you just—
I think the river thing worked,
Oh gee,
You think?
Be free.
Go back to your father,
I . . . I can't. He'll hate me now. I mean . . . even more.
You have to,
You owe me too.
Percy, I told you I was sorry. Please . . . let me come with you. I want to fight.
You'll be more help down here.
You mean you don't trust me anymore,
Just go back to your father,
That's a depressing thought.
Good luck. Now Mrs. O'Leary and I have to go.
Where?
Hey,
You get my message?
Percy, where have you been? Your message said almost nothing! We've been worried sick!
I'll fill you in later,
Where are you?
Trust me,
I'll see you there.
What is it?
What's what?
You're looking at me funny.
 I turned to the rest of the group. 
But you're our leader.
Let's go,
No,
Six-hundredth floor.
There is no six-hundredth floor, kid.
Make it quick.
You don't want us going through the metal detectors,
Um, no,
Elevator on the right. I guess you know the way.
Stayin' Alive.
You look . . . different,
Where exactly did you go?
Tell you later,
Come on.
Hate her,
Has she been cursing you or something?
Just little stuff so far,
Her sacred animal is the cow, right?
Right.
So she sends cows after me.
Cows? In San Francisco?
Look!
What is that?
Like infrared scopes,
We're being targeted.
Let's get to the palace,
room
Moooo!
Hey, man,
They treating you okay?
Mooo,
Lady Hestia.
You must be careful,
Um . . . what is she talking about?
Are you sure?
Something down here. I sense it.
Whoa!
No more monsters! Go away!
It's okay!
Thalia, put your shield up. You're scaring her.
Hey, it's all right,
Monsters!
No,
But we know all about monsters. We fight them too.
You're like me?
Yeah,
My family hates me,
They don't want me. I ran away.
What's your name, kiddo?
Annabeth.
You could?
Oh, yeah.
Knives are only for the bravest and quickest fighters,
I am!
You're . . . you're not going to take me back to my family?
Promise?
Deal!
Now, come on,
We can't stay put for long!
Just a little farther!
All right,
Luke, are you sure?
You swore you'd never come back here. If she catches you—
We don't have a choice!
This is your house?
It was my house,
Believe me, if it wasn't an emergency—
Is your mom really horrible?
Can we see her?
No!
I . . . I'm sorry,
You should not have come home.
Percy! What happened?
Did . . . did you see that?
See what?
How long was I out?
Um, Lady Hestia,
we've come on urgent business. We need to see—
We know what you need,
I will leave you now,
Hello, Percy.
Lord Hermes.
Hello, George,
Hey, Martha.
Um, Hermes,
I am his messenger. May I take a message?
You guys,
But—
That's a good idea,
Connor and Travis, you two lead.
We're on it!
My lord,
Your mother,
But it is a trap!
Is Zeus blind?
I'd watch the comments, girl,
But there are these blue lights—
Um . . . what about that materializing/teleporting thing you guys do?
Stayin' Alive.
Maybe just a few of you could come back,
I thought that was Kronos.
Met her at the Arch,
Not nice.
Progress?
He nearly destroyed St. Louis.
Yes,
Please, Hermes,
Messages,
Quiet, both of you,
Bah,
Anything else?
She said you should try plan twenty-three. She said you would know what that meant.
Go on.
Last thing.
Thank you, Hermes,
And I . . . I wanted to say . . . I'm sorry about Luke.
You should've left that subject alone.
Sorry?
SORRY doesn't cut it!
You should've saved him when you had the chance,
What are you talking about? Annabeth didn't—
Don't defend her, Jackson!
Maybe you should blame yourself!
Maybe if you hadn't abandoned Luke and his mom!
Percy Jackson,
My son, my greatest pride . . . my poor May . . .
Look, Lord Hermes,
I will leave you now,
I have a war to fight.
Annabeth,
Um, you didn't, right?
Percy,
What did you mean about Luke's mother? Did you meet her?
Nico and I visited her. She was a little . . . different.
That doesn't make sense. But why were you visiting—
Don't change the subject.
Percy! Did you or not?
Um . . . maybe a little.
Do you have any idea how dangerous that was?
I had no choice,
It's the only way I can stand up to Luke.
So now you're worried about Luke again,
What?
Forget it,
The point is he didn't die in the Styx,
I guess you're right. My mom mentioned—
Plan twenty-three.
Here it is,
Gods, we have a lot of work to do.
One of Daedalus's inventions?
 She looked at me. 
You need to see this,
Now.
I don't . . . hear anything,
What did they do?
What did they do to my city?
Are they dead?
Not dead,
You'd better get back to camp,
Guard it as best you can.
I'm staying,
Yes,
I think it's time.
For what?
Whoa,
A video shield.
One of Daedalus's ideas,
I had Beckendorf make this before—
Whoa,
Back up. Zoom in right there.
What?
You see invaders?
No, right there—Dylan's Candy Bar.
Connor!
Sorry,
This will let us see what's going on across the city,
Hey, girl,
You remember Grover? The satyr we met in the park?
WOOF!
I need you to find him,
This is a huge spell,
When did you learn so much about magic?
I don't spend all my time on my wardrobe.
Percy,
You'd better see this.
Scan the perimeter of the island,
Quick.
What's happening with the mortals outside Manhattan?
Is the whole state asleep?
Kronos,
He's slowing time.
Hecate might be helping,
I don't know.
Like flies in amber,
We shouldn't expect any help coming in.
All right,
We're going to hold Manhattan.
Um, Percy, Manhattan is huge.
We are going to hold it,
We have to.
He's right,
They have boats,
I'll take care of the boats,
How?
Just leave it to me,
Awwww!
Silena, take the Aphrodite crew to the Queens-Midtown Tunnel.
Oh my gods,
No delays,
Well . . . the perfume thing, if you think it'll work.
All right, enough!
Gladly. We've got a score to settle. For Beckendorf!
The 59th Street Bridge,
Clarisse—
We'll take that,
You got it.
I'll go with Percy,
Then we'll join you, or we'll go wherever we're needed.
No detours, you two.
All right,
Keep in touch with cell phones.
We don't have cell phones,
Uh, if we find a really nice phone—
No, you can't keep it,
Aw, man.
Hold it, Percy,
You forgot the Lincoln Tunnel.
How about you leave that to us?
Thalia!
The Hunters of Artemis, reporting for duty.
Where have you been the last year?
You've got like twice as many Hunters now!
Long, long story. I bet my adventures were more dangerous than yours, Jackson.
Complete lie,
We'll see,
Le Parker Meridien,
You're on. And Thalia, thanks.
Those monsters won't know what hit them. Hunters, move out!
Thank the gods,
You're right,
You're the greatest heroes of this millennium,
 I raised Riptide and shouted, 
Sorry, dude,
Pull over.
Why do we care about . . .
William H. Steward?
Seward,
Don't tell me he's an automaton,
To attack Olympus or defend it?
Uh-huh,
I have Daedalus's notes,
I think I can . . . Ah, here we go.
What's he going to do?
Take a memo?
Shh,
Hello, William.
Bill,
Bill . . . Oh, shut up,
Hello, er, Governor Seward. Command sequence: Daedalus Twentythree. Defend Manhattan. Begin Activation.
He's probably going to wake up Confucius,
What?
And then?
Hopefully, they defend Manhattan.
Do they know that we're not the enemy?
I think so.
That's reassuring.
We have to hurry,
Wait here,
Percy, you shouldn't go alone.
Well, unless you can breathe underwater . . .
You are so annoying sometimes.
Back in a flash.
HEY!
I heard the East River is more toxic,
You're the expert on stupid, East.
Watch it, Hudson,
Stay on your side of the island and mind your business.
Or what? You'll throw another garbage barge at me?
Hold it!
We've got a bigger problem.
The kid's right,
Let's both kill him, then we'll fight each other.
Sounds good,
Son of Poseidon?
Took a dip in the Styx?
Yep.
Well, that's perfect,
Now how do we kill him?
We could electrocute him,
If I could just find some jumper cables—
Listen to me!
Kronos's army is invading Manhattan.'
Don't you think we know that?
I can feel his boats right now. They're almost across.
Yep,
I got some filthy monsters crossing my waters too.
So stop them,
Drown them. Sink their boats.
Why should we?
So they invade Olympus. What do we care?
Because I can pay you.
It's mine!
Forget that,
We'll compromise.
You each get half,
In exchange, you keep all of Kronos's forces away from Manhattan.
Oh, man,
It's been so long since I was clean.
The power of Poseidon,
It's a deal.
Um, the invaders?
They just got sunk.
Bunch of hellhounds just took a dive.
Thank you,
Stay clean.
Curse of Achilles,
They always think that'll save them, don't they?
If only he knew,
It worked,
The rivers are safe.
Good,
Thanks for coming,
Hey, why do pegasi gallop as they fly, anyway?
We need to get to the Williamsburg Bridge,
There!
Blackjack, dive!
Drop us behind the lines with the Apollo cabin,
Glad you could join us,
Where are the other reinforcements?
For now, we're it,
Then we're dead,
You still have your flying chariot?
Nah,
Least you tried,
That was my last sonic arrow,
A gift from your dad?
God of music?
Loud music can be bad for you. Unfortunately, it doesn't always kill.
We have to fall back,
No,
How do you plan to do that?
Percy,
let me come with you.
Too dangerous,
Thanks a lot.
All right. Get moving.
Don't I get a kiss for luck? It's kind of a tradition, right?
Come back alive, Seaweed Brain. Then we'll see.
Hey, Beef Boy,
Didn't I kill you already?
One on one?
Just like old times?
Moo?
HAAA!
Thanks for playing,
invincible
Yes!
That's what I'm talking about!
Percy!
You've already routed them. Pull back! We're overextended!
Now,
we pull back.
Retreat!
I'll hold them.'
Annabeth!
Get back!
No one touches her!
Interesting,
Bravely fought, Percy Jackson,
But it's time to surrender . . . or the girl dies.
Percy, don't,
Blackjack!
Some day soon, I am going to make pegasus soup. But in the meantime . . .
I'll settle for another dead demigod.
So . . .
Michael, go!
Percy, the bridge!
It's already weak!
Break it!
Use your powers!
Until this evening, Jackson.
No!
Percy?
Are you supposed to be Demeter?
Everyone thinks I'm Demeter.'
Watch the bike,
Percy!
We're getting reports—
Later,
Where's Annabeth?
The terrace. She's alive, man, but . . .
Annabeth . . .
Poison on the dagger,
Pretty stupid of me, huh?
Ow,
Ow, ow!
That should do it,
But we're going to need some mortal supplies.
There's a Duane Reade on Fifth. Normally I would never steal—
I would,
Come on, guys,
Thanks, man,
Just take your time.
This is all my fault.
No,
Silena, how is it your fault?
I've never been any good at camp,
You're a great camper,
Please,
I can take a pegasus. I know I can make it back to camp. Let me try.
All right,
I can't think of anybody better to try.
You're cute when you're worried,
Your eyebrows get all scrunched together.
You are not going to die while I owe you a favor,
Why did you take that knife?
You would've done the same for me.
How did you know?
Know what?
The small of my back.
Where? Here?
You saved me,
Thanks.
So you owe me,
What else is new?
You asked me why Hermes was mad at me,
Hey, you need to rest—
No, I want to tell you. It's been bothering me for a long time.
Last year, Luke came to see me in San Francisco.
In person?
He came to your house?
This was before we went into the Labyrinth, before . . .
But you didn't trust him.
It's okay,
Try to get some rest.
Killed him?
You know that wouldn't have been right.
He did that,
He possessed Luke's body.
Percy.
Dude,
we're only borrowing this place.
Blah-ha-ha!
When you get nervous,
Yeah, I know. So what's up?
I heard about Annabeth. Is she . . .?
She's going to be fine. She's resting.
 He rubbed his forehead. 
We lost twenty satyrs against some giants at Fort Washington,
Great,
Any good news?
—she caught herself—
Okay. Any word from the gods?
So at best,
we've got another two days before he arrives.
Percy, something else,
Like he had inside information,
The spy.
What spy?
That's bad,
Very bad.
It could be anyone,
We were all standing there when Percy gave the orders.
But what can we do?
Frisk every demigod until we find a scythe charm?
We keep fighting,
Percy, you too,
Bianca,
But—
Why?
What's our father hiding?
What do you mean?
I have to know!
I know that,
But I'm not the same as I used to be, Bianca. Stop trying to protect me!
Maria di Angelo,
Speak to me!
Please, my dear,
No, my love.
But you already have Nico and Bianca. Surely—
Certamente,
We will stay together. Zeus is un imbecile.
You don't know my family,
Please, Maria, I can't lose you.
No!
Zeus!
I will crush you for this! I will bring her back!
My lord, you cannot,
You of all immortals must respect the laws of death.
Take them,
As you wish, my lord,
Take her as well,
Give her the ancient rites.
I warned you,
You dare come here?
I should blast you to dust!
You cannot,
The power of Delphi protects me.
You've killed the woman I loved!
Your prophecy brought us to this.'
Zeus ordained the explosion to destroy the children,
I couldn't! Maria would not let me! Besides, they were innocent.
I foresee the future,
I cannot change it.
Then, Oracle, hear the words of Hades,
You would not—
I swear,
And just what,
do you think you're doing?
What in the world?
Oh, gods,
That's what it means.
Dad.
We have to go back.
Back? We just got here.
There's trouble in New York. Percy's in danger.
Did he call you?
No . . . not exactly. But I know. It's a feeling.
No you haven't! You both hate the beach! You're just too stubborn to admit it.
Now, Rachel—
I think we would've heard some thing like that on the news.
No,
Not this kind of attack. Have you had any calls since we got here?
No . . . but it is the weekend, in the middle of the summer.
You always get calls,
You've got to admit that's strange.
We can't just leave. We've spent a lot of money.
Look,
Daddy . . . Percy needs me. I have to deliver a message. It's life or death.
What message? What are you talking about?
Then you can't go.
I'm listening.
Douglas? Prep the plane. We're leaving for New York. Yes . . . immediately.
I'll make it up to you, Dad!
Yes, Rachel,
You most certainly will.
Rachel, no!
Percy,
Come on. It's late afternoon. We've got visitors.
Visitors?
A Hyperborean,
You've met them?
The tux dude is the Titan?
He looks like a magician. I hate magicians. They usually have rabbits.
You're scared of bunnies?
Blah-hah-hah! They're big bullies. Always stealing celery from defenseless satyrs!
What?
We'll have to work on your bunny phobia later,
Here they come.
Percy Jackson,
It's a great honor.
My dear,
Why don't you make yourself comfortable over there, eh?
Hey, Ethan,
You're looking good.
To business.
I am Prometheus.
The fire-stealer guy? The chained-to-the-rock-with-the-vultures guy?
But—
Unlike the company you keep,
Oh, demons aren't so bad,
Uhoh.
Uh-oh.
We'll see.
Also the Titan of crafty counsel,
Emphasis on crafty.
Because Zeus chained you to a rock,
Your spy has been keeping you posted,
I won't let it happen,
So you're going to cram a wooden horse into the elevator at the Empire State Building?
Good luck.
Right,
And I'm supposed to believe Kronos would spare the city.
All he wants is Olympus,
Yes,
That's my mother's surname. I don't use it.
As you wish,
At any rate,
you need not be my enemy. I have always been a helper of mankind.
That's a load of Minotaur dung,
You don't understand. I helped shape your nature.
Uh-oh.
Percy, you know the Titans and their offspring are not all bad,
That's different.
 he pleaded. 
You must hate this.
I don't know what you mean.
Your mom's the goddess of revenge,
We should respect that?
Nemesis stands for balance! When people have too much good luck, she tears them down.
Which is why she took your eye?
It was payment,
Great mom.
At least she keeps her word, unlike the Olympians. She always pays her debts—good or evil.
Yeah,
So I saved your life, and you repaid me by raising Kronos. That's fair.
Now, now,
We're on a diplomatic mission.
It bothers you what happened to Luke,
Why show yourself now?
Luke, do not dishonor her,
So it was for my own good. Growing up on the streets, fending for myself, fighting monsters.
You're my son,
I'm not a god! Just once, you could've said something. You could've helped when
Luke, I care very much,
What?
What about my destiny?
You should not have come back,
We're doing fine without your help,
My son,
You don't love me.
Before what?
I cannot.
Then you don't care!
Luke?
Is that you? Is my boy all right?
I'm your father,
My boy, don't go!
I have your lunch ready!
My son,
Danger. Terrible fate!
I know, my love,
Believe me, I know.
Percy?
What . . . what was that?
Perrrcy,
he's playing with your mind. Trying to make you angry.
Do you really blame your friend Luke?
If you change your mind,
I have a gift for you.
That's not—
Yes,
You recognize it.
This belonged to my sister-in-law,
Pandora.
As in Pandora's box?
Don't forget me,
Indeed,
Hope,
I give you this as a reminder of what the gods are like,
I don't want the thing,
Too late,
The gift is given. It cannot be taken back.
Morrain!
We are leaving. Get your flag.
Uh-oh,
We will see you soon, Percy Jackson,
One way or another.
What did Prometheus show you?
That was a bad night,
I know what you mean,
Hermes knew,
It's still not right,
Percy,
She'll do fine.
You're right,
The last thing I need is more dreams.
I know, believe me.
You got it.
For Poseidon!
PUH PTEH BUN!
Nakamura,
The master would like to speak to you.
Something wrong?
You'll have to ask him.
Nice knowing you.
Well, Nakamura. What did you think of the diplomatic mission?
I'm sure Lord Prometheus is better suited to speak—
But I asked you.
Anything else you wanted to tell me?
You look nervous, Ethan.
No, sir. It's just . . . I heard this was the lair of —
Why turn them to stone,
when you can freeze time itself?
I . . . I don't know, sir.
Yes, you do.
She wanted to save him.
But he is invulnerable,
You saw that yourself.
I can't explain it. Maybe she forgot.
She forgot,
I see,
My lord?
I—
It is nothing,
A minor discomfort.
He's still fighting you, isn't he? Luke—
Nonsense,
As . . . as you say, my lord.
You!
Yesssss, my lord.
Is our little surprise ready to be unleashed?
Oh, yessss, my lord. Quite a lovely sssssurprissse.
Excellent,
It's an honor to have you here,
Don't encourage her,
May, you can't do this.
Oh, don't worry so much,
Longer,
It is,
We've been through that,
You couldn't marry if you became the Oracle,
You couldn't see me anymore.
It will,
I'll be right back.
No! NO!
Ow!
Sorry, Percy.
I was just about to wake you.
Percy?
What's wrong?
Nothing,
What . . . what are you doing in armor? You should be resting.
Oh, I'm fine,
Uh-huh. You can't seriously go out and fight.
You're going to need every person you have,
Heading south into Central Park,
Yeah, I know.
Do you think Ethan suspects about your weak spot?
I don't know,
He didn't tell Kronos anything, but if he figures it out—
We can't let him.
I'll bonk him on the head harder next time,
I didn't see anything in the shield, but I don't like surprises.
Agreed.
So,
are you going to argue about me coming along?
Nah. You'd just beat me up.
They're coming,
It's huge.
We'll hold them at the park,
Grover, you ready?
As ready as we'll ever be. If my nature spirits can stop them anywhere, this is the place.
Yes, we will!
Leneus?
Don't act so surprised,
Never fear! We'll show those Titans!
Say no more. The Hunters are ready.
Then let's do it,
Good hunting, everybody!
Positions!
Percy!
Hyperion,
The lord of light. Titan of the east.
Bad?
I'll keep him busy,
Percy, even you can't—
Just keep our forces together.
The sea god's brat,
You're the one who trapped Atlas beneath the sky again?
It wasn't hard,
You Titans are about as bright as my gym socks.
You want bright?
AHHHHH!
You will burn, Jackson!
Enough games,
We fight on land.
No,
I really hate it when you Titans do that.
Stop it!
Stop that wind!
Percy!
How are you doing that?
Sweet,
But a little more!
Percy!
Bring him over here!
I will not be toyed with!
What's this?
Stop this!
Your woodland magic is no match for a Titan!
You cannot imprison me!
I am Hyperion! I am—
You are a very nice maple tree.
REEEEET!
Why does that sound like . . . It can't be!
gift
REEEEEET!
A sow!
Take cover!
Don't tell me that thing is from Greek mythology,
Afraid so,
The Clazmonian Sow. It terrorized Greek towns back in the day.
Let me guess,
Hercules beat it.
Nope,
As far as I know, no hero has ever beaten it.
Perfect,
That pig has to go.
But, Percy,
what if we can't?
Retreat if you need to,
Just slow them down. I'll be back as soon as I can.
Watch out!
Stay alert!
I've got an idea.
OW!
No problem,
Follow that pig!
Get closer,
Just within shouting distance,
I need to talk to the statue.
Faster!
Get in front of the pig, Taunt him!
Trust me,
I can do this . . . probably.
REEEEEET!
You can defend Manhattan now,
I wish, big guy, but the fight's still going on.
We have to land where they need us most,
There!
Hey, ugly!
WAAAAH!
Thanks.
The pig?
Pork chops,
Good.
I'm fine, Percy. Come on! We've got plenty of enemies left.
Hold your lines!
We have to fall back to the doorway. Hold it at all costs!
Not the Hunters,
We're all here.
Then who?
Yeah, baby!
PARTY!
Centaurs!
Percy!
Sorry we're late!
DUDE!
Talk later. WASTE MONSTERS NOW!
PARTY PONIES.'
SOUTH FLORIDA!
HEART OF TEXAS CHAPTER!
HAWAII OWNS YOUR FACES!
Stop running, you fools!
Stand and ACKK!
HOLD! On your promise, HOLD!
Chiron's smart,
But the enemy—
They're not defeated,
But the dawn is coming. At least we've bought some time.
Dude,
That was more fun than our last convention in Vegas!
Yeah,
We totally wasted them!
Root beer!
Ack,
Enough of that, dog. Yes, I'm glad to see you too.
Chiron, thanks,
Talk about saving the day.
How'd you get through the magic defenses around the city?
They slowed us down a bit,
So maybe other reinforcements can get through,
And Typhon?
Then what chance do we have?
We can't hold out another day.
We'll have to,
I'll see about setting some new traps around the perimeter.
I will help her,
too overboard
At least your mom is okay,
If you call fighting Typhon okay.
I know.
Listen, there were some . . . some visions Hestia showed me.
You mean about Luke?
Yeah,
You and Thalia and Luke. The first time you met. And the time you met Hermes.
Thalia talked to me earlier,
She's afraid—
That I can't face Luke,
I didn't want to tell you,
I ran away when I was seven,
To build something permanent,
A monument to last a thousand years.
I guess that sounds like my fatal flaw again.
I guess I understand how you feel,
Oh good, you're here,
I'll have a Diet Coke.
Mr. D?
About as long as it'll take for you to figure out my name,
Where are we?
Why, Bobby Earl's birthday party,
Somewhere in lovely rural America.
I thought Typhon swatted you out of the sky. They said you crash-landed.
At a bar, playing Pac-Man.
Party time,
Safe little bubble?
So . . . I'm not really here?
And why did you bring me here?
Annabeth.
The point is,
I pulled you into party time to deliver a warning. We are in danger.
Gee,
Never would've figured that out. Thanks.
Erre es korakas, Blinky!
I will have your soul!
Um, he's a video game character,
That's no excuse! And you're ruining my game, Jorgenson!
Jackson.
Ha!
Take that, you pixelated fiends!
Um, fabric of civilization,
So why aren't the gods rushing back to help us?
You forgot my Diet Coke.
Gods, you're annoying.
The truth is, Pierre—
Percy.
Like Pan,
depending on the satyrs to save the Wild.
I feel so wanted. Thanks.
Use the training I have given you at camp.
What training?
You know. All those hero techniques and . . . No!
Yeah, making you proud is real high on my list.
Great. Nice little chat. Now, if you don't mind, my friends will be wondering—
There is more,
We kind of guessed that.
And that would mean . . .
You know about the true forms of the gods.
Yeah. You can't look at them without burning up.
Can I go now?
One last thing. My son Pollux. Is he alive?
Yeah, last I saw him.
I would very much appreciate it if you could keep him that way. I lost his brother Castor last year—
I remember.
I'll do my best.
Your best,
Nasty surprises?
What?
Um . . . nothing, I guess.
Percy!
Where are you going?
They . . . they must've seen those blue lights in the sky.
Percy,
I can't leave them here!
Percy, just . . . just hold on.
We can push the car to a side street, all right? They're going to be fine.
What's . . . Oh dear. I see.
They were coming to find me,
My mom must've sensed something was wrong.
Most likely,
No way,
That's impossible! I thought you left that at the Plaza.
Locked in a vault,
That isn't— 
Pandora's jar.
Then the jar is yours,
We'll put the car in neutral,
Push them out of the way. And take that stupid jar to Olympus.
A good plan. But, Percy . . .
DE
What is she doing here?
How did she get through the barrier?
Who?
What mortal would be insane enough—
The Morpheus enchantment!
The foolish mortal pilot is asleep.
Come on, Percy,
We have to save your friend.
Ideas?
You're going to have to take Guido and get out,
What are you going to do?
Hyah!
Duck!
Hang in there!
You can do it!
Just relax the wing. Extend it and glide.
I didn't know you could fly a helicopter.
Neither did I,
You saved my life,
I—
I had to be here. I knew Percy was in trouble.
Got that right,
It's okay,
How did you know about that?
A dream.
I've been seeing things too,
In Ancient Greek,
Do you know what they say?
Rachel,
I wish I knew. Maybe we should ask Chiron—
What do you mean? Whose death?
I don't know.
Don't you feel it?
Is that the message you wanted to tell me?
No.
Perseus,
In Ancient Greek.
You came thousands of miles to tell me I'm not the hero?
It's important,
It will affect what you do.
Not the hero of the prophecy?
Not the hero who defeats Kronos? What do you mean?
I'm . . . I'm sorry, Percy. That's all I know. I had to tell you because—
Well!
This must be Miss Dare.
Chiron, Rachel Dare,
Hello,
You are not asleep, Miss Dare,
And yet you are mortal?
I'm mortal,
Warn Percy?
She's been seeing things,
Writing lines and making drawings.
Indeed? Tell me.
Miss Dare . . . perhaps we should talk.
Chiron,
Everybody keeps telling me to sleep,
I don't need sleep.
Have you looked at yourself recently, Percy?
I look like death,
But you think I can sleep after what just happened?
You may be invulnerable in combat,
Sure,
Talk.
You have to!
I don't have to do anything!
I'm a god!
Father,
if Olympus falls, your own palace's safety doesn't matter. You'll fade too.
I am not an Olympian!
My family has made that quite clear.
You are,'' Nico said. 
You saw what they did to your mother,
Could we please not talk about that woman?
You know what would help this boy?
Farming.
Mother—
Six months behind a plow. Excellent character building.
Maria died!
You can't just cut yourself off from the other gods!
I've done very well at it for thousands of years.
And has that made you feel any better?
You're just as much of an outcast as I am!
Go ahead,
Yes, please,
Shut him up.
I hate this place,
Yes, lord.
That weakling destroyed an entire legion of telkhines with his arrows.
We will destroy them!
Y-yes, lord. At sunset?
No,
My lord?
But, my lord,
Your regeneration.
Does it seem,
that I need to regenerate?
Soon,
This is dangerous, my lord,
Do not be hasty.
Thrice you've fought him,
You call me weak?
No, my lord. I only meant—
Are your loyalties divided?
I misspoke, my lord. Your orders will be carried out.
PREPARE FOR BATTLE!
What was that?
They're coming,
And we're in trouble.
Your friend here has some useful insights, Percy,
Just some things I saw in my head.
A drakon,
A Lydian drakon, to be exact. The oldest and most dangerous kind.
How did you know that?
I'm not sure,
How can you possibly know that?
I just saw it. I can't explain.
Well, let's hope you're wrong,
Because we're a little short on children of Ares. . . .
What?
The spy,
I've already done it,
Rachel,
get inside the building.
I want to stay.
On second thought,
I'll be inside.
I'll take the drakon.
Will you help me?
That's what I do,
I help my friends.
Go invisible,
Look for weak links in its armor while I keep it busy. Just be careful.
Mrs. O'Leary, heel!
ROOOF!
YAAAH!
Thanks,
I told you to be careful!
Yeah, well, DUCK!
ARES!
The children of Ares!
How did Rachel know?
EEESSSSS!!!!!
Ares, to me!
We have to help,
Stay back, girl,
You've done enough already.
You can do it!
A child of Ares is destined to kill it!
ARES!
No,
WAIT!
Clarisse!
C'MON, you stupid worm! Look at me!
NO! Curse you, WHY?
WHY?
Look out!
YOU WANT DEATH?
WELL, COME ON!
What were you thinking?
So you stole my armor,
 She glared at her siblings. 
Don't blame them,
They wanted to . . . to believe I was you.
You stupid Aphrodite girl,
You charged a drakon? Why?
All my fault,
Stop it!
That's not true.
You were the spy.
Go, help the centaurs. Protect the doors. GO!
Forgive me.
You're not dying,
Charlie . . .
See Charlie . . .
We have to fight.
She was a hero, understand? A hero.
Come on, Clarisse.
Kronos is going to pay.
The blessing of Ares,
I've never seen it in person before.
I AM CLARISSE, DRAKON-SLAYER!
Clarisse!
Stop it. Withdraw!
What's the matter, Titan lord?
BRING IT ON!
I'll watch her. She'll get tired eventually. I'll make sure she comes inside.
What about the camp?
Is anybody left there?
Only Argus and the nature spirits. Peleus the dragon is still guarding the tree.
They won't last long,
But I'm glad you came.
My Hunters will help you stand guard,
Is it true?
About Silena?
She died a hero.
Um, I also heard—
That's it,
End of story.
Right,
That's our biggest advantage,
Any way to disable the elevator?
It's magic,
Then we have to keep them away from the doors,
We'll bottle them up in the lobby.
We need reinforcements,
They'll just keep coming. Eventually they'll overwhelm us.
There are no reinforcements,
Maybe that's not true,
Hey, girl.
I know you're tired, but I've got one more big favor to ask you.
Leneus!
Grover?
I'm here, Leneus.
Did . . . did we win?
Um . . . yes,
Thanks to you, Leneus. We drove the enemy away.
Told you,
True leader. True . . .
A laurel,
Oh, that lucky old goat.
I . . . I should plant him. In Olympus, in the gardens.
We're going that way,
Come on.
Percy,
You were right about Luke.
Annabeth,
I'm sorry—
You tried to tell me.
That doesn't make me happy.
You'll be up and fighting Titans in no time!
You look great,
Leneus turned into a shrub!
I can still fight with the other hand,
No,
You've done enough. I want you to stay here and help with the wounded.
But—
Promise me to stay safe,
Okay? Personal favor.
Rachel?
Um, what are you doing with that?
I found it. It's Pandora's jar, isn't it?
Please put down the jar,
I can see Hope inside it.
So fragile.
Rachel.
Grover,
But—
Right!
I love traps!
Come on,
I want you to meet someone.
Lady Hestia,
Hello, Percy Jackson,
Getting colder. Harder to keep the fire going.
I know,
The Titans are near.
Hello, my dear. You've come to our hearth at last.
You've been expecting me?
To claim your place at the hearth,
I . . . I understand.
Wait,
What is she talking about?
Wait. Now I'm a distraction? Is this because I'm 'not the hero' or whatever?
I'm not sure I can put it into words,
 She gestured at the throne room. 
So . . . what,
Thanks for bringing me to Olympus. See ya.' Is that what you're saying?
Percy Jackson,
Percy?
Should we, um, leave again?
You're worried about me doing something stupid?
But I mean . . . will you be okay?
I don't know,
That kind of depends on whether you save the world, hero.
Hestia,
I give this to you as an offering.
I am the least of the gods. Why would you trust me with this?
You're the last Olympian,
And the most important.
And why is that, Percy Jackson?
Because Hope survives best at the hearth,
Well done, Percy Jackson,
May the gods bless you.
We're about to find out.
Come on, guys.
Help me up,
'Are you crazy?
Probably,
Percy,
I need to get his attention,
It's the only way.
Well,
this'll get his attention.
I'm sorry, Father,
I needed to get your attention.
I'm sorry,
Listen, things are rough up here.
I'm at your home,
Olympus.
Is Tyson okay?
peanut butter
You let him fight?
And Olympus might be saved.
Dad—
I am praying. I'm talking to you, right?
Are you okay? You turned pale and . . . you started smoking.
I did not!
If you'd sat there any longer,
We'll find out soon,
You've got to get down there,
The enemy is advancing. And Kronos is leading them.
Chiron,
Step aside, little son.
I'm afraid not.
Chiron!
Look out!
You're a teacher,
Not a hero.
Luke was a hero,
He was a good one, until you corrupted him.
FOOL!
Me,
You said me.
BACK!
No!
YOU!
To think that I . . . that I thought—
Annabeth, don't.
I HATE you!
I have to fight him,
It's my fight too, Percy!
Arroooooooo!
Mrs. O'Leary?
Nico?
ROWWF!
Son of Hades.
Do you love death so much you wish to experience it?
Your death,
would be great for me.
I'm immortal, you fool! I have escaped Tartarus. You have no business here, and no chance to live.
I don't agree.
HOLD YOUR GROUND!
The dead are no match for us.
Hello, Father. You're looking . . . young.
Hades,
I hope you and the ladies have come to pledge your allegiance.
I'm afraid not.
 He glanced at me with distaste. 
True,
No appreciation of agriculture.
Mother!
I don't have time for this,
What's he doing?
Sealing us in,
No,
Don't . . .
ATTACK!
Nakamura,
Attend me. Giants—deal with them.
Paul?
Mom!
Nice one,
When did you learn to fire a shotgun?
About two seconds ago. Percy, we'll be fine. Go!
Yes,
we'll handle the army. You have to get Kronos!
Come on, Seaweed Brain!
Mrs. O'Leary,
Jump!
Gods, I hate heights!
Percy!
Um, thanks,
Uh duh.
Keep moving!
We're marooned,
On our own.
Blah-ha-ha!
The gods won't move on to another country this time,
Kronos's scythe,
That was a shrine to Artemis,
He'll pay for that.
Look out!
Thalia!
I survive all those battles,
and I get defeated by a stupid chunk of rock!
It's Hera,
Well, don't just stand there! I'll be fine. Go!
We'll be back,
I'm not going anywhere,
We've got to run,
I don't suppose you mean away,
I was afraid of that,
Finally!
My lord,
Shall I destroy you first, Jackson?
Luke would fight with a sword,
But I suppose you don't have his skill.
Percy, the blade!
The hero's soul, cursed blade shall reap.
Wait!
ARG!
Luke, listen!
Annabeth!
Nakamura!
Look around you, Ethan,
There is no throne to Nemesis,
No throne to my mother.
That's right!
Strike them down! They deserve to suffer.
You said your mom is the goddess of balance,
Treason,
Deserve better,
If they just . . . had thrones—
So much for him.
And now for the rest of you.
Oh, yes,
This one will make fine kindling for my new hearth!
It's too late, Percy Jackson,
Behold.
The Olympians are giving their final effort.
How pathetic.
No!
NO!
NOW, MY BRETHREN!
STRIKE FOR OLYMPUS!
Tyson!
BAH!
They're on their way,
You've lost.
I haven't even started.
STOP!
Luke,
I understand now. You have to trust me.
Your mother,
She saw your fate.
Service to Kronos!
This is my fate.
No!
That's not the end, Luke. The prophecy: she saw what you would do. It applies to you!
I will crush you, child!
You won't,
You promised. You're holding Kronos back even now.
LIES!
Family, Luke. You promised.
Promise.
Annabeth . . .
You're bleeding. . . .
My knife.
Percy, please . . .
Don't touch her,
Jackson . . .
NO!
The knife, Percy,
Hero . . . cursed blade . . .
Please, Percy . . .
Please,
No time.
Percy? Are you . . . um . . .
Good . . . blade,
You knew. I almost killed you, but you knew . . .
Shhh.
You were a hero at the end, Luke. You'll go to Elysium.
Think . . . rebirth. Try for three times. Isles of the Blest.
You always pushed yourself too hard.
Did you . . .
Did you love me?
There was a time I thought . . . well, I thought . . .
You were like a brother to me, Luke,
But I didn't love you.
We can get ambrosia,
We can—
Grover,
You're the bravest satyr I ever knew. But no. There's no healing. . . .
I won't,
I promise.
Percy,
What . . . what is this?
We need a shroud,
A shroud for the son of Hermes.
Wait,
Farewell,
Oh gods,
Annabeth, I'm sorry.
It's all right,
She needs help!
I've got this.
Thanks, Apollo,
I'll, um, let you handle the poetry.
That drakon-slaying? THAT'S what I'm talking about!
a pretty bang-up job, mostly.
I suppose I won't destroy you and that little girl now.
Annabeth saved Olympus,
She convinced Luke to stop Kronos.
Hmm,
Urn, yes, sir,
Fifty years, huh?
Don't get so excited, Jackson,
Naturally.
Just so we understand each other.
They will listen,
Thanks, Percy. I hope . . . I hope you know I'm really proud to be your friend.
Luke was right about one thing, G-man. You're the bravest satyr I ever met.
Percy!
You are not dead!
Yeah!
Amazing, huh?
Tyson led us,
He is brave!
Bravest of the Cyclopes!
Was nothing.
I saw you!
You were incredible!
Yes. Um . . . three cheers for Tyson!
YAAARRRRR!
Please don't eat me,
Tyson!
Well done, my son. And Percy—
Dad—
Shhh,
POSEIDON!
Well, Poseidon?
Are you too proud to join us in council, my brother?
Miss much?
Nobody's planning to kill us, so far,
First time today.
As for my brothers,
we are thankful
erm, thankful for the aid of Hades.
And, of course,
I'm sorry, brother,
What was that?
We must thank Poseidon,
Without whom . . . it would've been difficult—
Difficult?
Impossible,
Impossible to defeat Typhon.
Which leaves us,
Probably.
Okay,
I'll streamline their application process.
Thank you, my lady.
Tyson, son of Poseidon!
Doesn't miss many meals, does he?
Stick!
Very well,
We will grant you a new, er, stick. The best stick that may be found.
Hooray!
Grover Underwood of the satyrs!
Oh, stop chewing your shirt,
Oh, wonderful,
FOOOOOD,
Annabeth Chase, my own daughter.
My . . . my lady?
You mean . . . I can design whatever I want?
As your heart desires,
Make us a city for the ages.
As long as you have plenty of statues of me,
And me,
Hey, and me!
Big statues with huge wicked swords and—
All right!
Way to go,
PERCY JACKSON!
Rise, my son,
A great hero must be rewarded,
The Council agrees,
Percy Jackson, you will have one gift from the gods.
Any gift?
Um . . . a god?
Hmm,
I approve as well,
No,
No?
You are . . . turning down our generous gift?
I'm honored and everything,
I do want a gift, though,
Do you promise to grant my wish?
If it is within our power.
It is,
And it's not even difficult. But I need your promise on the River Styx.
What?
You don't trust us?
Someone once told me,
you should always get a solemn oath.
Guilty.
Very well!
From now on, I want to you properly recognize the children of the gods,
Percy,
what exactly do you mean?
 I said. 
You dare accuse—
No more undetermined children,
Now, wait just a moment,
And the minor gods,
Are you calling me a minor god?
No, my lord,
Is that all?
Percy,
you ask much. You presume much.
I hold you to your oath,
All of you.
Humph,
Being told what to do by a mere child. But I suppose . . .
All in favor,
Um, thanks,
Honor guard!
All hail, Perseus Jackson,
Hero of Olympus . . . and my big brother!
I'll meet you at the elevator.
You sure?
Yeah, you're sure.
Amazing,
Thanks, I guess.
Oh, not you. Although, I suppose I should wonder, turning down immortality.
It was the right choice.
How bad is the city?
You?
And why is that?
I thought you were a bad father,
I did know his future,
You had to let him find his own path,
and play his part in saving Olympus.
Annabeth did save him,
Luke died a hero. He sacrificed himself to kill Kronos.
I appreciate your words, Percy. But Kronos isn't dead. You can't kill a Titan.
Then—
I don't know,
What about the other Titans?
In hiding,
A long time ago,
And now you know I'm a hypocrite?
Too late for him and me.
You have other children. Honor Luke by recognizing them. All the gods can do that.
You can change.
After three thousand years, you think the gods can change their nature?
Yeah,
I do.
You think . . . Luke actually loved me? After all that happened?
I'm sure of it.
I promise,
And I won't forget.
Percy Jackson,
you might just teach us a thing or two.
Well, Percy,
You will stay mortal.
Um, yes, ma'am.
I would know your reasons.
I want to be a regular guy. I want to grow up. Have, you know, a regular high school experience.
And my daughter?
I couldn't leave her,
Or Grover,
Or—
Spare me.
Why do you smell like smoke?
Long story,
I'm telling you,
we have to go up! My son—
Percy!
We saw the building lit up blue,
She was getting a bit anxious,
I'm all right,
Everything's okay now.
Mr. Blofis,
that was wicked sword work.
Olympus,
Yeah.
I'd like to see that.
Paul,
It's not for mortals. Anyway, the important thing is we're safe. All of us.
It's Rachel,
I just ran into her down on 32nd Street.
What's she done this time?
It's where she's gone,
She took my pegasus?
She's heading to Half-Blood Hill. She said she had to get to camp.
What was she thinking?
She'll never get through the defenses,
Peleus will eat her.
We've got to hurry.
I don't suppose you could conjure up some skeleton horses.
So tired . . . couldn't summon a dog bone.
Rainbow!
How's it going, buddy?
Yeah, I'm sorry,
But it's an emergency. We need to get to camp.
Tyson?
Tyson is fine! I'm sorry he's not here. He's a big general now in the Cyclops army.
NEEEEIGGGGH!
Yeah, I'm sure he'll still bring you apples. Now, about that ride . . .
Is she here?
Is everything okay?
What's she doing?
How did she get past the barriers?
She flew,
Rachel!
Percy, don't,
You can't interrupt.
I thought you explained things to her!
I did. And I invited her here.
You said you'd never let anyone try again! You said—
And if the curse isn't lifted? If Hades hasn't gotten to that yet, she'll go crazy!
Hey!
Stop!
It's all right.
This is why I've come.
You'll be destroyed!
This is where I belong, Percy. I finally understand why.
You've waited too long,
But I'm here now.
Apollo,
Rachel Elizabeth Dare,
It's my destiny.
Do you accept the risks?
I do.
Then proceed,
Stop! This is the most delicate part.
What's going on?
What do you mean?
Either the spirit takes hold, or it doesn't.
And if it doesn't?
Five syllables,
That would be real bad.
Percy.
Are you okay?
Ow.
Rachel,
your life aura almost faded completely. I could see you dying.
I'm all right,
Please, help me up. The visions—they're a little disorienting.
Are you sure you're okay?
You're kidding,
You mean you can tell the future now?
Not all the time,
It's starting,
I'm all right,
What was that?
What was what?
I believe,
that we just heard the next Great Prophecy.
What does it mean?
I don't even remember what I said.
No,
What?
But—
Percy,
Maybe,
but it didn't sound so good.
No,
It certainly didn't. She's going to make a wonderful Oracle!
I'm sorry, Percy,
I still don't,
But I guess I'm happy for you.
Will you still go to Clarion Academy?
I made a promise to my father. I guess I'll try to be a normal kid during the school year, but—
But right now you need sleep,
No, indeed.
Rachel may use a guest room in the Big House for now, until we give the matter more thought.
I'm thinking a cave in the hills,
What?
Good-bye, Percy,
No.
Good,
Grover!
Hey.
Happy birthday.
What?
It's August 18th,
Your birthday, right?
Make a wish,
Did you bake this yourself?
Tyson helped.
That explains why it looks like a chocolate brick,
With extra blue cement.
You saved the world,
We saved the world.
And Rachel is the new Oracle, which means she won't be dating anybody.
You don't sound disappointed,
Oh, I don't care.
Uh-huh.
You got something to say to me, Seaweed Brain?
You'd probably kick my butt.
You know I'd kick your butt.
Yeah?
Then up on Olympus,
when they wanted to make me a god and stuff, I kept thinking—
Oh, you so wanted to.
Anyone in particular?
You're laughing at me,
I am not!
You are so not making this easy.
Well, it's about time!
Oh, come on!
Is there no privacy?
The lovebirds need to cool off!
The canoe lake!
We can hardly keep up,
We're going to need a bigger travel budget, and I could use a hundred more satyrs.
Yeah, but the satyrs you have are working super hard,
I think they're scared of you.
That's silly. I'm not scary.
You're a lord of the Wild, dude. The chosen one of Pan. A member of the Council of—
Stop it!
You're as bad as Juniper. I think she wants me to run for president next.
It's going to be a lot different next summer,
Yeah,
but it'll be the same old place.
I'll be traveling a lot,
Won't change anything,
You're still my best friend.
Except for Annabeth.
That's different.
Yeah,
It sure is.
Hey, Dad,
What brings you here?
Never really got to talk in private on Olympus. I wanted to thank you.
Thank me? You came to the rescue.
Not eating size,
Little ones?
Ha-ha.
Um, you were kidding, right?
I'll see you soon, Percy. And remember, know which fish are big enough to land, eh?
Never forget this summer!
And now,
Good-bye,
You'll do great.
Well,
you two be good to each other.
And close to me?
Well, someone's got a big sense of his own importance.
You've been thinking about Rachel's prophecy?
How did you know?
Because I know you.
Yep,
And all that stuff about the world falling in storm or fire.
Wouldn't be Camp Half-Blood if it was peaceful,
I guess you're right . . . Or maybe the prophecy won't happen for years.
Could be a problem for another generation of demigods,
Race you to the road?
You are so going to lose.
