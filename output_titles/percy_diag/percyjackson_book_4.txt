Just relax.
Destroy it?
Yes.
I thought we should wait,
So we don’t scare him away.
I’m sure orientation will be fine, Percy, It’s only one morning.
Great,
I can get expelled before I start the school year.
It’s not a date!
It’s just Annabeth, Mom. Jeez!
She’s coming all the way from camp to meet you.
Well, yeah.
You’re going to the movies.
Yeah.
Just the two of you.
Mom!
You’d better get inside, dear. I’ll see you tonight.
Percy?
What’s wrong?
N-nothing,
Does the school have a side entrance?
Down the block on the right. Why?
I’ll see you later.
Hi!
Welcome to Goode,
You are so going to love it.
What’s your name, fish?
Fish?
Freshman.
Uh, Percy.
Oh, Percy Jackson,
We’ve been waiting for you.
Percy?
Ow,
Watch it, fish.
There you are!
Welcome to Goode!
Hey, Paul—uh, Mr. Blofis.
Percy, you look like you’ve seen a ghost.
Yeah, uh—
Where’s the orientation?
The gym. That way. But—
Bye.
Percy?
We prepare to excel early!
Rachel Elizabeth Dare,
Look, I wasn’t—I didn’t—What are you doing here?
Same as you, I guess. Orientation.
You live in New York?
What, you thought I lived at the Hoover Dam?
Hi, guys!
My name is Tammi, and this is like, Kelli.
Run,
Now.
Why?
Get over here!
Keep your head down!
Did they follow you?
You mean the cheerleaders?
I don’t think so,
What are they? What did you see?
You…you wouldn’t believe me.
Oh, yeah, I would,
I know you can see through the Mist.
The what?
Tell me,
Like…the Minotaur and the Hydra?
Yeah, just try not to say those names when I’m around, okay?
And the Furies,
And the Sirens, and—
Okay!
All those monsters,
all the Greek gods—they’re real.
I knew it!
You don’t know how hard it’s been,
Wait. Who are you? I mean really?
I’m not a monster.
I’m a half-blood,
I’m half human.
And half what?
There you are, Percy Jackson,
They’re horrible!
What do they really look like?
Oh, forget her.
Percy,
Uhhh?
Percy!
Snap out of it!
Oh, come on,
May I, mistress?
Get back.
Freshmen,
This is our school, halfblood. We feed on whom we choose!
A vampire!
Don’t mention the legs!
It’s rude to make fun!
A vampire, you say?
Mmmm.
I don’t usually kill girls,
No!
Gross!
Monsters do that,
Sorry.
You killed my trainee!
I am senior empousa,
Yeah?
Then you’re overdue!
Such a pretty little blade,
Poor dear.
Excellent! We’re about to have company!
Percy!
Stop it!
Time to greet our visitors!
Percy, don’t!
Oh no, please!
Percy?
What have you done?
You have to get out of here!
Hey, you’re out early!
Watch where you’re going, Seaweed Brain.
Percy, wait up!
What did you do this time? And who is this?
Hi,
Percy,
We should go.
I want to know more about half-bloods,
But—
I’ll make up some story,
Hey!
There were these two empousai,
You told a mortal girl about half-bloods?
She can see through the Mist. She saw the monsters before I did.
So you told her the truth?
She recognized me from Hoover Dam, so—
You’ve met her before?
Um, last winter. But seriously, I barely know her.
She’s kind of cute.
I—I never thought about it.
I’ll deal with the school,
Honest, it’ll be fine.
You’re right,
Any word on Luke?
problem.
Mount Tam is still overrun with monsters,
What about Grover?
He’s at camp,
We’ll see him today.
Did he have any luck? I mean, with the search for Pan?
You’ll see,
Yes, please,
Hey, Peleus,
Keeping everything safe?
I need to talk to Clarisse,
What for?
We’ve been working on something,
I’ll see you later.
Working on what?
I’ll tell Chiron you’re here,
What hearing?
Yeah,
Great talking with you, too.
Yaaaaah!
WOOF!
Whoa there!
Truce!
WOOF!
That’s a hellhound!
She’s harmless,
That’s Mrs. O’Leary.
Mrs. O’Leary?
Good girl,
Mrs. O’Leary is my pet,
Who are you?
I guess.
Quintus.
Percy Jackson,
Sorry about—How did you, um—
Oh.
Whoa, girl!
Those aren’t for you.
What’s in the boxes?
A little surprise,
Uh, okay,
You—you’re a half-blood?
You know about my prophecy?
I’ve heard a few things.
Percy, there you are!
I see you’ve met our new instructor.
Quintus, do you mind if I borrow Percy?
Not at all, Master Chiron.
No need to call me ‘Master’,
Come, Percy. We have much to discuss.
Well, see you,
Mysterious?
Hard to read?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mm,
What were they doing there?
Waiting for me?
Possibly,
I would’ve been,
Except for Rachel.
Where?
At his formal hearing,
Punk,
No, no,
He’ll be fine, Juniper.
Master Underwood!
B-but Silenus,
It’s the truth!
But I did!
Impudence!
Now, Maron,
Patience.
Patience, indeed!
Wrong fight, girlie,
Wait.
For six months,
I just need more time,
Nothing!
You have found nothing.
But, Leneus—
Master Underwood,
Thank you!
One more week.
What? But sir! That’s impossible!
But sir, I—I can’t lose my searcher’s license. My whole life—
This meeting of the council is adjourned,
Hi, Percy,
That went well, huh?
Those old goats!
There is another option,
No. No.
Grover, I won’t let you.
What are you talking about?
pretty.
male god
Percy!
Hey, big guy!
Ow, watch the ribs. The ribs.
You are okay?
Not eaten by monsters?
Not even a little bit.
Yay!
But first,
we’ve gotta worry about inspection. We should…
Tyson, the cabin looks…amazing!
See the fish ponies? I put them on the ceiling!
You fixed it!
Oh, my.
Well, I had my doubts. But you clean up nicely, Percy. I’ll remember that.
Lots of bad people above the sea, too,
What’s this ‘other way’?
Goat boy scares me,
Why would you be scared of Grover?
Hooves and horns,
Good try,
But your guard is too low.
Have you always been a swordsman?
I’ve been many things.
What’s that on your neck?
A reminder.
little doggie.
Big crack,
No,
Not an earthquake.
Nico di Angelo,
So he put a crack in the floor?
These skeletons attacked us,
Nico is a son of Hades.
The god of dead people.
Yeah.
So the Nico boy is gone now?
The bad prophecy,
Titans might use him if they knew.
Exactly,
So—
Mouth sealed,
Like the crack in the ground.
O, Iris, Goddess of the rainbow,
Useless,
I can’t believe I ever liked this stuff.
A childish game, master,
I’ve failed,
There’s no way to get her back.
Is there? Speak.
It has never been done,
But there may be a way.
Tell me,
An exchange,
A soul for a soul.
I’ve offered!
Not yours,
Not that again. You’re talking about murder.
I’m talking about justice,
Vengeance.
Those are not the same thing.
You will learn differently as you get older.
I will help you,
Very well. You have a plan?
Oh, yes,
It’s still out there,
You did well, Lee,
Aye,
We’ll see how you all do with that tonight.
Yes…
To the gods.
Poseidon,
I will go…um…polish my fish ponies.
Uh, fine.
I brought Grover over,
What’s he talking about?
I’ll tell you what it’s about,
The Labyrinth.
You’re not supposed to be here,
We need to talk,
But the rules…
Look,
Exactly,
So…it’s not under the king’s palace in Crete anymore,
No.
If you don’t get lost,
And die a horrible death.
Grover, there has to be a way,
Clarisse lived.
Barely!
And the other guy—
He was driven insane. He didn’t die.
Oh, joy.
Whoa,
Back up. What’s this about Clarisse and a crazy guy?
Last year,
I remember,
It was secret.
It was secret,
because she found Chris Rodriguez.
The guy from the Hermes cabin?
Yeah,
What do you mean he just appeared?
String,
Okay,
Why were they exploring the Labyrinth?
We weren’t sure,
Except it’s a maze, right?
Full of horrible traps,
But not if you had Ariadne’s string,
So Luke is trying to find Ariadne’s string,
You think Pan is underground?
It would explain why he’s been impossible to find.
But,
It could lead you to the wild god,
I can’t do it.
Grover, it may be your last chance,
We’ll talk later,
Don’t say that! We’ll figure something out.
I have to leave,
You know those aren’t good for you, Blackjack.
You may be right, Blackjack. We’ll see.
Right,
Gather ’round.
You will be in teams of two,
AWWWWW!
I will now announce your partners,
Aroooof!
Nice.
Your armor is crooked
Grover Underwood,
with Tyson.
What? B-but—
No, no,
Must be a mistake. Goat boy—
No complaining!
They’ll be fine,
This is where we stopped looking.
I saw him last night,
What do you mean?
He’s summoning the dead? That’s not good.
The ghost was giving him bad advice,
He’s going to come after me,
The spirit mentioned a maze.
That settles it. We have to figure out the Labyrinth.
Maybe,
That’s not the Stoll brothers,
Over there,
No, wait,
Behind us.
Hi.
Put those down!
Dryads don’t like sharp blades, okay?
Juniper,
What are you doing here?
I live here.
In the boulders?
In the juniper. Duh.
Are you guys busy?
Well,
We’re not busy,
What’s wrong, Juniper?
No,
I’m sure that’s not it.
He had a crush on a blueberry bush once,
Juniper,
He can’t go underground!
You can’t let him.
Ah.
About that…
Hide!
One of us gets behind it,
Cuts off its tail while the other distracts it in front.
I’ll take point,
You’ve got the invisibility hat.
Three?
Climb?
No time,
Look out!
In here,
I’ll cover you. Go!
Wh-where are we?
Safe from the scorpions, anyway,
It’s a long room,
It’s not a room. It’s a corridor.
Don’t take another step,
We need to find the exit.
It’s okay,
It’s right—
Two steps back,
Okay,
Help me examine the walls.
What for?
The mark of Daedalus,
Uh, okay. What kind of—
Got it!
Percy! Annabeth!
Where have you two been?
We’ve been looking forever.
But we were gone only a few minutes,
Percy!
You are okay?
We’re fine,
We fell in a hole.
Honest!
You’ve been missing for almost an hour,
Yeah,
We would’ve won, but a Cyclops sat on me.
Was an accident!
A hole?
Chiron…maybe we should talk about this at the Big House.
You found it, didn’t you?
I—Yeah. Yeah, we did.
This explains a lot,
It explains what Luke is after.
Wait a second,
What do you mean? What did we find?
Father!
What did they do to you?
I’ll kill you!
There will be no killing today,
You did that yourself, Your Majesty,
Stop!
You love your maze so much,
I don’t fear you,
What shall we do?
Father, they will kill you!
Take heart, my son.
I—I will find a way.
Luke must have known about the Labyrinth entrance,
He knew everything about camp.
She has good taste,
I wouldn’t have paid any attention except…well, it was Luke.
Forget what I said about good taste.
Interesting,
Definitely,
He’s been sending scouts into the maze,
Chris Rodriguez,
Ah,
The one in the…Yes, I understand.
The one in the what?
The guy who created the maze.
Yes,
We need to go in,
Wait a second,
Great idea!
I’ll get the dynamite!
It’s not so easy, stupid,
We could fight,
We will certainly set up defenses,
We have to get to Daedalus’s workshop first,
But if nobody can navigate in there,
what chance do we have?
I’ve been studying architecture for years,
From reading about it.
Well, yes.
That’s not enough.
It has to be!
It isn’t!
Are you going to help me or not?
We all know who should lead this,
Annabeth.
You’ve done as much as I have, Clarisse,
I’m not going back in there.
Don’t tell me you’re scared. Clarisse, chicken?
I didn’t mean to—
Very well,
Percy,
What do you mean?
Who?
The sword master,
He was poking around the rocks.
Quintus? When?
What was he doing? Did he go in?
Juniper?
Where’d you go?
It’s okay,
Try a little more nectar.
You’re an illusion, Mary!
My name’s not Mary.
It’s dark!
So dark!
Come outside,
The sunlight will help you.
A…a thousand skulls. The earth keeps healing him.
Chris,
The son of Poseidon! He’s horrible!
My dear,
You made it.
The dead, the traitor, and the lost one raise.
The lost one! That must mean Pan! That’s great!
With the dead and the traitor,
Not so great.
And?
What is the rest?
You shall rise or fall by the ghost king’s hand,
Hey…we shouldn’t jump to conclusions,
But who’s this ghost king?
Are there more lines?
I don’t remember exactly.
And?
Will you come?
I’m in.
Grover, you too? The wild god is waiting.
lost one
And Tyson,
I’ll need you too.
Yay! Blow-things-up time!
Wait, Annabeth,
I need them all,
Chiron, it’s important.
Annabeth.
I know. But we have to. Please.
I have a bad feeling about this,
I don’t like the idea of you going down there,
You’ve been in there?
Long ago.
A whistle?
A dog whistle,
For Mrs. O’Leary.
Um, thanks, but—
What ice?
Thanks,
Hello?
Knock, knock?
Oh…hi. Didn’t hear you.
You okay?
We’ll figure it out,
I’ve wanted to lead a quest since I was seven,
You’re going to do awesome.
Hey, we’re your friends. We wouldn’t miss it.
But…
What is it?
The prophecy?
I’m sure it’s fine,
What was the last line?
Hey, it’s…it’s okay.
Chiron might be right,
Then don’t worry about it,
This is different. I don’t want anything happening to…any of you.
Um, sorry,
We were just looking at maps,
Okay.
Tell Chiron I’ll be right there,
Annabeth?
You’re wondering which hero? I don’t know.
Our spies report success, my lord,
But the form, my lord…
Yes, my lord. It’s just—
Yes.
Come in.
Hello, Luke,
What is it, demon?
That was before I saw what you did to that boy in Seattle.
Oh, he meant nothing to me,
Thanks, but no thanks. Now report or get out.
What is it?
A presence,
You’re trying to tell me something,
All right,
Show me Nico di Angelo.
Is it deep enough yet?
Nearly, my lord.
I want a second opinion!
You are dismissed,
Thank you.
You might as well thank the shovels,
Let the dead taste again,
In my day, we used animal blood,
I will treat them with respect,
At least let me keep the toy,
Be quiet!
There are too many,
I’ve got it under control,
One at a time,
Who are you?
Speak.
I am Theseus.
How can I retrieve my sister?
Do not try. It is madness.
Just tell me!
My stepfather died,
My lord, the soul exchange! Ask him about that!
That voice. I know that voice.
No you don’t, fool!
I know you,
I want to hear about my sister,
We don’t need any of that,
A soul for a soul,
Is it true?
I—I must say yes. But the specter—
Just answer the questions, knave!
I want to see my sister!
Where is she?
He is coming,
Who?
He comes to find the source of this power,
Stop,
Stop it!
Percy, you look terrible.
He killed the water fountain last night,
What?
Of course, my boy.
Be right back, guys.
Last night,
I dreamed about Luke and Kronos.
I feared this,
Do you know what he meant about a bargain?
Not anyone,
What else would he want?
Indeed,
We’ve got to get to Daedalus first,
and convince him not to.
I don’t know,
That does not surprise me.
It doesn’t sur—you mean you know?
Then why did you let him in?
Percy, you ready?
Take care,
And good hunting.
You too,
Well,
good-bye sunshine.
Hello rocks,
If we keep one hand on the left wall and follow it,
Um, which way did we come in?
Just turn around,
Left walls are mean,
Which way now?
That way,
How do you know?
Deductive reasoning.
So…you’re guessing.
Just come on,
Are we there yet?
We’ve been down here maybe five minutes,
It’s been longer than that,
Whoa.
What is this place?
It looks—
Roman,
But how can they be Roman?
The Labyrinth is a patchwork,
You make it sound like it’s alive.
Let’s not talk about it being alive,
Please?
All right,
Forward.
Down the hall with the bad sounds?
Yeah,
I’m thinking this is not Roman,
A milkman,
What?
They used to deliver milk.
Some people wander in by mistake,
He’s been down here a long time.
Only bones,
Don’t worry, goat boy. The milkman is dead.
The milkman doesn’t bother me,
Oh, good,
I thought maybe I was wrong.
We have to get deeper into the maze,
Well, Annabeth?
Hurry up!
Don’t mind him,
Uh…I don’t…
That funny man has two faces.
The funny man has ears, you know!
No, no,
This way, miss. Talk to me, please.
The exits are closed,
Duh!
Where do they lead?
One probably leads the way you wish to go,
The other leads to certain death.
I—I know who you are,
Oh, you’re a smart one!
Why are you trying to confuse me?
I—
We know you, Annabeth,
No…I don’t—
Leave her alone,
Who are you, anyway?
I’m your best friend,
I’m your worst enemy,
I’m Janus,
I’ll see you soon enough, Perseus Jackson,
Such fun!
Shut up!
Don’t do it,
I’m afraid she has to,
I—I chose—
Janus,
are we causing trouble again?
N-no, milady!
Yes!
Shut up!
Excuse me?
Not you, milady! I was talking to myself.
I see,
What kind of door?
Shut up!
Because French doors are nice,
Shut up!
Causing indecision,
Now be gone!
Party power,
You must be hungry,
Sit with me and talk.
Who…who are you?
I am Hera.
Queen of Heaven.
Grover, dear,
use your napkin. Don’t eat it.
Yes, ma’am,
Yes, nice lady.
Queen Hera,
I came to see you, naturally,
I didn’t think—
Didn’t you try to kill him, like, a lot of times?
You mean when he sired Thalia?
Percy Jackson, isn’t it? One of Poseidon’s…children.
Trying to,
Your father?
Oh, right.
We must watch the minor gods,
That’s where Dionysus went,
Indeed.
What are your goals?
A wish?
But how do we get there?
I don’t understand.
The means is already within your grasp.
I do?
But that’s not fair,
You’re not telling me what it is!
Poof,
Well,
But I don’t,
I don’t know what she was talking about.
All right. Then we’ll just keep going.
Which way?
Left,
How can you be sure?
Because something is coming from the right,
Something big,
In a hurry.
Left is sounding pretty good,
Tyson,
can you—
Yes!
Hurry!
Don’t bring the roof down, but hurry!
Close the entrance!
We trapped it,
Or trapped ourselves,
What in Hades?
A prison,
Maybe Tyson can break—
Shh,
Listen.
what’s that language?
Can’t be.
What?
Wait!
I know this place,
This is Alcatraz.
You mean that island is near San Francisco?
My school took a field trip here. It’s like a museum.
Freeze,
Stop, Tyson!
Can’t you see it?
It’s her,
Get down!
What’s she saying?
What’s that language?
The tongue of the old times.
You understand it?
Can you translate?
You will work for the master or suffer.
I hate it when he does that.
I will not serve,
H-h-horrible,
Cyclopes’ worst nightmare,
Kampê.
Who?
The Heka-what?
The Hundred-Handed Ones,
Very powerful,
Cool,
Unless you’re a mountain.
Kampê was the jailer,
And now Kampê is back,
Bad,
So who’s in that cell?
You said a name—
Briares!
Yeah,
They break mountains.
I guess we should check it out,
Either the sky isn’t as tall as it used to be,
or he’s short.
Briares!
Great Hundred-Handed One!
Help us!
Run while you can, Cyclops,
You are a Hundred-Handed One!
I cannot,
Put on your brave face!
No good,
My scared face keeps coming back.
How did you do that?
Must make it hard to get a yearbook picture,
Do you have one hundred pens?
Guys,
Break the bars,
Yes!
If he’s so strong,
why is he stuck in jail?
He’s terrified,
Briares?
Tyson,
I think you’d better break the bars.
I will break the bars,
Come on, Briares,
Let’s get you out of here.
I cannot,
She will punish me.
It’s all right,
I remember the war.
Don’t listen to her,
Come on!
One game of rock, paper, scissors,
I always win rock, paper, scissors.
Then let’s do it!
I told you,
I always—
What is that you made?
A gun,
That’s not fair.
Demigods are cheaters.
The other way,
Left,
I remember this from the tour.
It’s even worse,
Keep moving,
She is behind us!
Kampê’s too big to get through the doors,
Poison!
Don’t let those things touch you or…
Or we’ll die?
Well…after you shrivel slowly to dust, yes.
Let’s avoid the swords,
Briares, fight!
Grow to full size!
Run.
The boat?
Too slow,
Back into the maze. Only chance.
We need a diversion,
I’ll help you,
No,
Are you sure?
Go, brother. I will meet you inside.
Can’t make it,
Tyson is risking his life to help you!
You will make it.
Hurry!
Look for the mark!
There!
You can do it!
This pit goes straight to Tartarus,
Don’t talk that way,
I have nothing to offer,
I have lost everything.
What about your brothers?
They are no more. They faded.
What exactly do you mean, they faded?
Percy,
I must go,
Kronos’s army will invade camp,
We need help.
I cannot, Cyclops.
You are strong.
Not anymore.
Hey,
Maybe that’s why monsters fade,
It’s okay,
It’s not okay, goat boy. He was my hero.
We must be close to Daedalus’s workshop,
How do we know when it’s morning?
Just rest,
I’m sorry I lost the shield,
You worked so hard to repair it.
He was just scared,
I’m sure he’ll get over it.
He is not strong,
He is not important anymore.
You should sleep,
Can’t. You doing all right?
Sure. First day leading the quest. Just great.
We’ll get there,
We’ll find the workshop before Luke does.
I just wish the quest was logical,
Space isn’t the same in the maze.
I know, I know. It’s just…
You made a cute guinea pig.
And Waterland, how you got us thrown off that ride?
I got us thrown off? That was totally your fault!
See? It’ll be fine.
I don’t know,
Honestly.
You’d tell me if you did?
Sure. Maybe…
Maybe what?
Maybe if you told me the last line of the prophecy, it would help.
Not here. Not in the dark.
What about the choice Janus mentioned? Hera said—
Stop,
Nico is down here somewhere,
How about I take first watch?
Done,
It’s done.
Father, you’re a genius!
You first,
The wax compound should hold for several hours,
And the sun’s heat would loosen them,
One cannot be too careful.
Too slow,
I am too slow.
Take your time, Father,
The guards aren’t due until—
Hurry!
We must have more time,
It’ll be fine,
Well, well,
Going somewhere?
We’re leaving, Minos,
You look like metal chickens,
Perhaps we should pluck you and make a soup.
Metal chickens,
Soup.
Shut up,
The vent!
Get them!
Shoot them!
Free, Father! You did it.
Wait!
Be careful!
Stop that!
Icarus!
Father!
This isn’t right,
It should still be stone.
It smells like the Underworld in here.
Nico,
He was summoning the dead again.
Ghosts were here. I don’t like ghosts.
We’ve got to find him.
Percy!
Where are we?
It’s a cattle guard,
A what?
How do you know that?
All right. But how do we get out?
Sorry, cow!
Red cattle,
The cattle of the sun.
What?
They’re sacred to Apollo.
Holy cows?
Exactly. But what are they doing—
Wait,
Listen.
Bad Janus dog!
Arf!
Heel, Orthus,
What’ve we got here?
Cattle rustlers?
Just travelers,
We’re on a quest.
Half-bloods, eh?
How did you know—
Cyclops,
Yes, I can see that.
The other one?
You mean Nico di Angelo?
We get a load of visitors from the Labyrinth,
Wow,
I feel welcome.
We’re not leaving,
What are they for?
Like who?
No more questions.
It looks like a Frank Lloyd Wright!
Don’t break the rules,
Why?
What does he look like?
Say Hello to Mr. Geryon.
Hi,
Nice chests—uh, ranch! Nice ranch you have.
Geryon, I won’t wait for—
But that’s—
Percy Jackson,
Monster friends?
That man is wearing three shirts,
They let my sister die!
Nico, we’re not here to kill you.
Don’t speak her name! You’re not worthy to even talk about her!
Wait a minute,
I believe you,
We have a huge operation!
Horses and cattle mostly, but all sorts of exotic varieties, too.
Rooster ponies,
Do they lay eggs?
Once a year!
That’s horrible!
They must be an endangered species!
That’s not right,
Now, over here,
What war?
So many,
Yes, well, Apollo is too busy to see them,
For what?
Meat, of course! Armies have to eat.
You kill the sacred cows of the sun god for hamburger meat?
That’s the against ancient laws!
Oh, don’t get so worked up, satyr. They’re just animals.
Just animals!
Yes, and if Apollo cared, I’m sure he would tell us.
If he knew,
Triple G Ranch,
Quintus…
Short gray hair, muscular, swordsman?
Yeah.
Never heard of him,
What is that?
My stables!
They’re disgusting!
Lots of poop,
How can you keep animals like that?
Y’all getting’ on my nerves,
Plus, you’re too cheap to have them cleaned,
Quiet!
What clients?
You’re a monster,
You have to let these animals go,
It’s not right!
And the clients you keep talking about,
I came here for business, Geryon,
Mmm.
Yes, you’ll get a deal, all right.
Wait a second,
I thought I was the soul you wanted.
Oh, I imagine I could,
Minos?
It’s none of your business, Percy!
No.
I would stay in the car, all of you,
Do I have to?
Yes, you fool!
Pick up the sword, too,
Now,
You fiend!
Paid by whom?
What do you mean?
Never you mind, darlin’. Let’s be off, shall we?
Wait!
What sort of deal? Do you have gold?
I’ve got something better. Barter.
But Mr. Jackson, you’ve got nothing.
You could have him clean the stables,
I’ll do it!
Assuming the horses don’t eat you,
Either way, you get my friends,
No!
So what have you got to lose?
Deal.
I hope you know what you’re doing,
I hope so, too.
Sunset,
No later.
Oh no you don’t,
Are you a naiad?
Of course!
But you speak English. And you’re out of the water.
What, you don’t think we can act human if we want to?
Look,
I just came to ask—
I know who you are,
But—
My friends are in danger,
Okay, you win.
Really?
I’m not going to fight you. It’s your river.
Oh. Oh, good. I mean—good thing for you!
I’ll tell you a secret, son of the sea god. Scoop up some dirt.
What?
You heard me.
Those are shells,
Okay,
What good does that do me?
I hope you find a way to rescue your friends.
No way,
Get bigger,
More!
Stop,
Stop!
On one condition,
Let them go!
Let my friends go,
We had a deal.
You promised!
Eurytion,
the boy is starting to annoy me. Kill him.
Kill him yourself,
Excuse me?
You heard me,
And who’d take care of your cattle? Orthus, heel.
Fine!
I’ll deal with you later, after the boy is dead!
Aghhh!
Nice try, sonny,
Coward!
Come back and die right!
You fool! One arrow is no better than one sword.
Thanks, guys,
I owe you one.
Yay for Percy!
Can we tie up this cowherd now?
Yeah!
And that dog almost killed me!
How long will it take Geryon to re-form?
You said you’d died for him before,
How?
Maybe you can change things,
How?
That’d be all right.
Now, that I could live with.
You won’t try to stop us leaving?
Shoot, no.
Your boss said somebody paid for our safe passage. Who?
Maybe he was just saying that to fool you.
What about the Titans?
You could stay here until we’re done with our quest,
Safe?
Nico,
I’m not on anyone’s side. And I’m not afraid.
You should be,
Your sister wouldn’t want—
If you cared for my sister, you’d help me bring her back!
A soul for a soul?
Yes!
But if you didn’t want my soul—
I’m not explaining anything to you!
And I will bring her back.
Bianca wouldn’t want to be brought back,
Not like that.
You didn’t know her!
I’ve tried,
She won’t answer.
Try again. I’ve got a feeling she’ll answer with me here.
Why would she?
Because she’s been sending me Iris-messages,
She’s been trying to warn me what you’re up to, so I can protect you.
That’s impossible.
One way to find out. You said you’re not afraid.
We’re going to need a pit, like a grave. And food and drinks.
Percy,
I don’t think this is a good—
All right,
I’ll try.
Minos should be here by now,
It’s full dark.
Maybe he got lost,
Make him stop,
Stop him!
Minos!
What are you doing?
My apologies, master,
The sacrifice smelled so good, I couldn’t resist.
It is good to see myself again. Almost in solid form—
You are disrupting the ritual!
Get—
Yes, quite right, master,
We’re looking for Bianca di Angelo,
Get lost.
Daedalus cares nothing for you, half-bloods,
The guilt of murder?
Who did he kill?
Do not changed the subject!
Enough, Mions,
The others?
The maze is my property,
Be gone, Minos!
I want to see my sister!
Bianca, appear!
Any time now,
Hello, Percy,
Bianca,
I’m so sorry,
Bianca!
Hello, Nico. You’ve gotten so tall.
Why didn’t you answer me sooner?
I was hoping you would give up.
Give up?
You can’t, Nico. Don’t do this. Percy is right.
No! He let you die! He’s not your friend.
You must listen to me,
I can’t. Never.
So it was you,
You sent those Iris-messages.
Why are you helping him and not me?
It’s not fair!
You are close to the truth now,
No.
She’s right,
I don’t care about Kronos,
I just want my sister back.
You can’t have that, Nico,
I’m the son of Hades! I can.
Don’t try,
If you love me, don’t…
Tartarus stirs,
Wait,
Please—
Good-bye, Nico,
I love you. Remember what I said.
Issss it time, my lord?
Soon,
Continue your work.
My lord,
You have a visitor,
You.
You’re a jailor,
Your job—
We should have left that one in Tartarus,
You should not fear power, Luke. Use it!
The sooner we leave, the better,
I want this over with.
Aww,
I didn’t say that.
You’re not having second thoughts about your own, ah, special part?
I know my duty.
That is good,
We have more than enough,
Mmm,
Oh, yes.
Uncle!
Hello, Perdix,
Yes, Uncle. They were easy!
Oh, yes! Look!
I see. Not bad.
The king loved it!
Did he now?
Yes,
So when I die, you can take my place, eh?
But why?
No, my boy,
I don’t think so,
With the use of a little magic—
Magic? Bah!
Can I fix that astrolabe, then, Uncle? Are your joints swelling up again?
Smarter than me,
Take my place,
I would like to fly,
Perdix,
Catch.
Uncle!
Help me!
Go on, Perdix,
Uncle!
Percy?
Are you okay?
What—what time is it?
Two in the morning,
I miss Juniper.
What?
That can’t be right.
Time is faster in the Labyrinth,
Oh,
Right.
I’m out of time,
We’ll talk to them,
Make them give you more time.
Hey,
Don’t say that. You’re just as much a hero—
No I’m not. I keep trying, but…
We’ll figure out something,
Champion goat boy,
Nico, you could come with us,
I need time to think.
Nico,
Bianca just wants you to be okay.
I’m worried about him,
He’ll be al right,
What about you?
Well, good luck.
Yep.
Can you help us?
That’s what Hera said,
Hephaestus comes here from time to time,
And you’re giving it to me?
Spider!
She’s, um, a little scared of spiders,
Oh.
Sorry, miss.
Hurry,
That thing’s not going to wait for us.
Monkey bars,
I’m great at these.
Sphinx.
Welcome, lucky contestants!
Fabulous prizes!
I’ve got this,
Sorry,
Welcome, Annabeth Chase!
Are you ready for your test?
Yes,
Ask your riddle.
Twenty riddles, actually!
What? But back in the old days—
Okay,
I’m ready.
What…is the capital of Bulgaria?
Sofia,
but—
Correct!
What?
Make sure you bubble each answer clearly and stay inside the circle,
What machine?
Now,
next question—
Wait a second,
I beg your pardon?
Exactly why we changed the test!
Four,
but—
Correct! Which U.S. president signed the Emancipation Proclamation?
Abraham Lincoln, but—
Correct! Riddle number four. How much—
Hold up!
These aren’t riddles,
What do you mean?
It’s just a bunch of dumb, random facts,
Think?
Stop!
This is a stupid test.
Um, Annabeth,
I’m a child of Athena,
Why then, my dear,
No!
Turn invisible,
I can fight!
No!
The Sphinx is after you! Let us get it.
No fair!
Cheater!
My grading machine!
Annabeth!
Here!
Keep moving!
Ready to meet Hephaestus?
No,
Yes!
Well, well,
There,
Much better.
I didn’t make you, did I?
Uh,
no, sir.
Good,
Shoddy workmanship.
Half-bloods,
We’ve met, sir,
Have we?
Satyr.
Uh…
Yes, well said,
Sir,
Daedalus?
Uh, yes, sir, please,
Humph. You’re wasting your time.
Y-yes, lord. We met a Hundred-Handed One.
Briares?
Yes. He—he was scared. He would not help us.
And that bothered you.
Yes!
But I thought Zeus did that to you,
Mother likes telling that version of the story,
Believe me, young Cyclops,
Oh, this one doesn’t like me,
We told you,
Why not?
You know where he is, then,
It isn’t wise to go looking, girl.
My mother says looking is the nature of wisdom.
Who’s your mother, then?
Athena.
Figures.
Name it,
You heroes,
One of my forges,
That’s Mount St. Helens,
Great forests around there.
You’ve been there?
Looking for…you know, Pan.
Wait,
What do you want us to do?
Fight him?
You want us to find out who it is,
Aye,
Glad you noticed,
Go and find out what you can,
All right,
How do we get there?
My creation will show you the way,
What is it?
Come on!
We have to keep moving.
This is the way,
This is it.
What way?
You mean…to Pan?
Don’t you smell it?
Dirt,
And plants.
Yes! This is the way. I’m sure of it!
Well come back,
The tunnel will be gone by then,
But we can’t,
The forges!
I have to, Annabeth. Don’t you understand?
We’ll split up,
No!
I—I will go with him.
Tyson, are you sure?
I hope you’re right,
I know I am.
Be careful,
This is bad,
Splitting up is a really, really bad idea.
We’ll see them again,
Hey, wait up,
Yeah?
Something Hephaestus said back there…about Athena.
She swore never to marry,
But then—
How come she has demigod children?
Percy, you know how Athena was born?
She sprung from the head of Zeus in full battle armor or something.
So your dad and Athena…so you weren’t…
I was a brain child,
But—
Um…no. That’s okay.
I thought not.
Hold it!
Bring it in?
Yeah,
Movie’s just about done.
Oi,
Thing weighs a ton.
It’s celestial bronze,
What did you expect?
Just set it in the back,
Now, younglings,
Sea demons!
No. Anyone else?
Telekhines!
Very good,
And why are we here?
Revenge!
Yes, yes, but why?
Zeus is evil!
Indeed,
And so, younglings,
who do we serve?
Kronos!
Yes!
A demigod!
Eat it!
Back off!
New lesson, class,
CLASS DISMISSED!
Annabeth!
Shhh!
You want to get us killed?
Percy, what is your problem?
We’re going to have company!
So that’s what they are,
The blade is almost complete,
Aye,
It shall be even sharper than before.
What is that?
They were talking about the greatest Titan weapon,
The telekhines betrayed the gods,
With Kronos.
We have to get out—
Put your cap back on,
Get out!
What?
No! I’m not leaving you.
But you’ll be killed!
I’ll be fine. Besides, we’ve got no choice.
Be careful, Seaweed Brain.
There!
What do we have here? A son of Poseidon?
Yes,
I can smell the sea in his blood.
Strike down one of us, demigod,
Your father’s nature protects you,
Stay still,
You’re too weak to rise.
Who?
Shhh, brave one,
Holy Poseidon,
Well,
the sleeper finally wakes.
Who were you talking to?
Oh…just a messenger,
How do you feel?
How long have I been out?
Time,
You know my name?
You talk in your sleep.
Yeah. I’ve been…uh, told that before.
Yes. Who is Annabeth?
I’m sorry,
Is that near Mount St. Helens?
It isn’t near anything, brave one,
But my friends—
Annabeth,
And Grover and Tyson?
Yes!
Why would you think that?
Or anything else?
I am no evil sorceress,
Rest,
Percy, what do you see?
I was just looking at…
That’s moonlace,
It can only be planted at night.
What does it do?
Do?
I suppose not,
It’s awesome,
Back home,
my mom always wanted a garden.
Why did she not plant one?
Well, we live in Manhattan. In an apartment.
Manhattan? Apartment?
You don’t know what I’m talking about, do you?
I fear not. I haven’t left Ogygia in…a long time.
Well, Manhattan’s a big city, with not much gardening space.
Why haven’t you left your island?
It is my punishment.
Why? What did you do?
I? Nothing. But I’m afraid my father did a great deal. His name is Atlas.
Still,
What is it?
What? I asked. “I don’t know.
You want me to go?
I…
I’ll see you in the morning. Sleep well.
There it is again,
What?
You keep pulling away, like you’re trying not to enjoy yourself.
How? Tell me. I want to help.
Don’t say that. Please don’t say that.
Tell me what the punishment is.
Because your father was Atlas.
But that’s not fair,
But, Percy,
What? But the Titans are evil!
Are they? All of them? All the time?
Perhaps I was wrong in the war,
You don’t have any friends?
What is that?
A visitor.
Lord Hephaestus,
This is a rare honor.
Stupid servants,
Hephaestus,
what’s going on? Is Annabeth—
She’s fine,
You haven’t told her I’m okay?
That’s not for me to say,
What do you mean?
Of course I’m coming back!
Still uncertain about further eruptions,
You caused quite an explosion.
The telekhines were scattered,
I couldn’t release him, could I? I mean, I’m not that powerful!
What about Grover and Tyson?
So what am I supposed to do?
Aphrodite.
Is this part of her plan?
Did she land me here?
Yeah,
Yeah, I know.
Then you’ll need to decide whether or not you’re leaving.
I…
Don’t decide yet,
Will Daedalus even help us?
It isn’t easy being a brilliant inventor,
I’ll—I’ll try.
He has ordered you to return,
Well, not ordered. He gave me a choice.
I promised I would not offer.
Offer what?
For you to stay.
Stay,
Like…forever?
You would be immortal on this island,
Just like that?
Just like that.
But…my friends.
What? What have I done to make you sad?
They send a person who can never stay,
Me?
If you could see your face.
Of course, you.
That’s why you’ve been pulling away all this time?
But…I’m just…I mean, I’m just me.
That is enough,
I can’t,
I would never do anything to hurt you,
Then come to the beach, my hero. And we will send you on your way.
This will take you wherever you desire,
Maybe I can visit you,
But—
Go, please.
I promise.
Camp Half-Blood,
Sail me home.
—assume he is dead,
He’s right there!
Percy!
Well,
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?
I—we thought you were dead, Seaweed Brain!
I’m sorry,
I got lost.
LOST?
Two weeks, Percy? Where in the world—
Annabeth,
You’ve been gone two weeks.
When I heard the explosion, I thought—
I know,
He told you the answer?
Percy, that’s crazy!
But this is my quest,
I need to lead it.
And this is supposed to help? Please! It’s wrong. It’s cowardly. It’s—
Hard to admit we need a mortal’s help,
But it’s true.
She will calm down,
She’s jealous, my boy.
That’s stupid. She’s not…it’s not like…
We won’t dwell on your choices,
Tell that to Annabeth.
Chiron,
what about Grover and Tyson? Do you think—
I don’t know, my boy.
Grover and Tyson are very resourceful, however. We can still hope.
I shouldn’t have let them run off.
I suppose. The empathy link. But—
There is something else I should tell you, Percy,
Great.
Chris Rodriguez, our guest…
Is he dead?
Not yet,
I’m sorry to say,
Disappeared? How?
He’s a spy for Luke.
It can’t be a coincidence.
What about Mrs. O’Leary?
Quintus wouldn’t just leave her.
Whoa!
Whoa, girl!
Can’t breathe. Lemme up!
Where’s your master?
You’re lucky she didn’t bite your head off.
Came here to practice yesterday,
She’s an intelligent dog,
Funny.
Stupid hellhound,
I heard about Chris,
I’m sorry.
Yeah, well. Sometimes things go wrong.
Chris was brave,
I hope he gets better.
Do me a favor,
Yeah, sure.
Clarisse—
Practice time is over. From now on, it’s for real.
Minos, King of Crete!
That is not your concern.
Father,
Ingenious man,
Oh, indeed. My daughters’ tutor. They are quite fond of him.
I would be careful of that.
Yes,
He is a thief,
I offer you a choice,
Father,
you can’t—
Silence, Aelia.
The gods do not love those who harbor criminals, either.
Very well. You shall have your man in chains.
Father!
This way, Your Majesty,
Ahh.
You have been chasing your prey ten years, my lord?
You must be very determined.
I never forget a debt.
Oh, indeed, my lord!
You know, my lord,
Daedalus spoke to you about me?
Yes, my lord.
He is a genius,
What do you want?
Why do you do this?
You tell Daedalus,
Brave words, Your Majesty,
A painless death,
Yes,
I fear I have brought you trouble.
Somewhere safe,
Then where will you go?
A place I swore never to enter again,
I do not understand,
It’s best you did not.
But what of the Underworld?
Perhaps,
Find me if you dare, king of the ghosts.
You never told us of secret passages!
You have been busy.
The Labyrinth has been busy,
It should’ve been the last turn.
Sir!
Maps are useless here,
Don’t worry. I’ll find it.
Sir, is it true that the larger the group—
But how will we get the thread?
Sir!
The dracaenae found a half-blood!
Alone? Wandering the maze?
Who is it?
No one I’ve ever seen before, sir.
A blessing from Kronos. We may be able to use this halfblood. Come!
An Iris-message from Eurytion.
Eurytion! Is something wrong with Nico?
He left the ranch last night, heading back into the maze.
He’s in danger,
That’s not what I meant,
I had this dream last night…
That’s very, very bad.
So what do we do?
I told them you were all right,
So,
Yep,
That pretty much covers it.
I wish Paul were here,
Oh, right. The school.
What did you tell him?
I’ll talk to him,
You would do that?
Well, yeah. I mean, he’ll think we’re crazy.
He already thinks that.
Then there’s nothing to lose.
Thank you, Percy. I’ll tell him you’ll be home…
Percy has this plan.
It sounds very dangerous. But it might work.
You have the same abilities, don’t you?
We’ll try, Ms. Jackson,
I see,
Well, remember,
Grover and Tyson are counting on you two.
I know,
Maybe if we push her over,
Hey, Percy.
Good timing! Let’s get some coffee.
So,
it’s Annabell, right?
Annabeth,
Do you always dress in gold?
Not usually,
Shhh!
Okay.
That’s not funny,
This isn’t a joke, mortal girl.
Hold it, you two,
Just calm down.
I’m calm,
Look,
Nah. They asked me a lot of questions about you. I played dumb.
Was it hard?
Okay, stop!
You need my help?
Yeah,
Maybe.
So you want me to guide you,
You can see through the Mist,
And if you’re wrong?
I could die?
Yeah.
Yeah,
Nice guy,
He’s under the influence of a Titan,
Okay,
I’m in.
Are you sure?
We have to find an entrance to the Labyrinth,
Okay. What does an entrance to the Labyrinth look like?
It could be anything,
Like this?
That’s it,
You know Greek?
No,
Why?
It hasn’t been used in a long time,
I tried to open it once,
No.
It just needs the touch of a half-blood.
Wow.
So…after you?
You’re the guide,
Lead on.
A Cyclops,
It’s very old. It’s not…anybody we know.
You have a friend who’s a Cyclops?
Tyson,
My half brother.
Your half brother.
Hopefully we’ll find him down here,
And Grover. He’s a satyr.
Oh.
Well then, we’d better keep moving.
That looks like the tunnel Tyson and Grover took.
We need to go straight,
That’s the least likely choice,
You don’t see it?
Look at the floor.
There’s a brightness there,
You believe her?
Yeah,
Don’t you?
No traps?
Nothing.
Should it be this easy?
I don’t know,
It never was before.
So, Rachel,
where are you from, exactly?
Brooklyn,
Aren’t your parents going to be worried if you’re out late?
Why not?
What was that?
I don’t know,
Metal hinges.
Oh, that’s very helpful. I mean, what is it?
Run?
Run,
Well, well,
Taking your little mortal pet for a walk?
Can I eat them?
No,
Oh, yessssss,
Who’s your host?
My what?
You stay here.
Hey!
I’m sorry. I’ll get you out of this.
Luke,
Help!
DEATH! DEATH!
Please! No!
Good entertainment!
Lord Antaeus,
A favor I have not yet granted,
If his death pleases you,
Perhaps!
perhaps.
Luke!
Stop this. Let us go!
Annabeth?
Enough time for the females to fight afterward,
First, Percy Jackson, what weapons will you choose?
How can you be a son of Poseidon?
I am his favorite son!
Percy!
His mother is Gaea! Gae—
You’re crazy, Antaeus,
Weapons,
Just my sword,
Round one!
No!
Nice job, Percy.
Round two!
Who are you?
Ethan Nakamura,
I have to kill you.
Why are you doing this?
Hey!
Stop talking and fight already!
I have to prove myself,
Only way to join up.
Blood!
Boo!
Stand and fight!
Get it over with,
Forget it.
Don’t be a fool,
They’ll just kill us both.
No one dishonors the games!
When you see your chance, run.
I am the greatest wrestler in the world, boy,
Pankration?
He means fighting to the death,
Thanks for the tip,
Don’t mention it.
This shouldn’t take long. I swear to your terms!
Good luck,
You’ll need it.
Weapons?
I’ll stick with my sword. You?
With pleasure.
Argggh!
Now you see why I never lose, demigod!
Puny boy,
Not a worthy son of the sea god!
HEY!
Come down here, coward!
WAAA!
Get me down!
Free him!
He is our host!
I’ll free him.
Jackson!
I should have killed you long ago!
You tired,
Spare the girl.
I would speak to her before—before our great triumph.
What was that supposed to do?
AROOOOF
Let’s go!
Heel, Mrs. O’Leary!
The far exit!
That’s the right way!
This way!
Why should we follow you?
It was the way you needed to go,
Duck!
You people are crazy.
Yeah, and you’re Annabeth. I remember.
What—what happened to your eye?
You must be the half-blood from my dream,
Who’s Nico?
Never mind,
Gee, I wonder.
We’re going after Daedalus,
You really are crazy if you think Daedalus will help you.
He has to,
We’ll make him listen.
Yeah, well. Good luck with that.
Something was wrong with Luke,
Did you notice the way he was acting?
He looked pretty pleased to me,
You’re impossible,
So which way now, Sacagawea?
We’ll follow the path,
The brightness on the floor.
The brightness that led us straight into a trap?
Lay off her, Annabeth,
She’s doing the best she can.
Annabeth’s usually not like this,
Are you sure you don’t know?
What do you mean?
Boys,
Totally blind.
No, you were right,
Hey, I’m usually about to die,
Don’t feel bad.
I paint. I read a lot.
What about your family?
Oh…they’re just, you know, family.
You said they wouldn’t notice if you were gone.
Oh, sure. Sorry if…
I’ll take first watch,
You should sleep, too.
You don’t have to act like that.
Like what?
Like…never mind.
So close to your own destruction, little hero,
And still you are blind.
I have much to thank you for,
You have assured my rise.
A favor,
Hurry!
It’s going to eat you!
How do you know?
It just told me! Run!
No!
Percy, wake up!
Tyson—Tyson’s in trouble!
We have to help him!
First things first,
Earthquake!
Rachel!
You know what?
I like this way after all.
There,
This way,
We’re close!
This is so wrong!
We’re here,
Daedalus’s workshop.
So much for ancient architecture,
Di immortals,
He’s a genius. Look at the curves on this building!
And an artist,
These wings are amazing!
Where are we?
Colorado Springs,
The Garden of the Gods.
You,
What have you done with Daedalus?
Trust me, my dear. You don’t want to meet him.
Look, Mr. Traitor,
You think I’m an agent of Kronos,
That I work for Luke.
Well, duh,
You’re an intelligent girl,
Luke mentioned you,
Of course,
I’ve been almost everywhere. Even here.
The view changes from day to day,
You’ve been here before,
Oh, yes.
That’s an illusion out there?
A projection or something?
No,
It’s real. We’re really in Colorado.
Enough games,
What have you done with Daedalus?
I knew that
LIAR!
Yeah right, and I’m Zeus.
I am both,
That’s true,
You see?
A girl of many talents.
But you don’t even look like Daedalus,
Yes,
You’ve finally guessed the truth.
You’re an automaton. You made yourself a new body.
Percy,
Do you know what Quintus means, my dear?
The fifth, in Latin. But—
This is my fifth body.
That’s amazing!
That’s weird,
You found a way to transfer your animus into a machine?
That’s…not natural.
A murderer’s brand,
For your nephew, Perdix,
I did not push him. I simply—
Made him lose his balance,
Let him die.
You really are Daedalus,
So you have talked to Luke.
Oh, yes. Several times. He is quite persuasive.
But now you’ve seen the camp!
Privacy from what?
The gods,
But how can you hide from Hades?
They do not know everything,
You mean Minos,
And you did,
for two thousand years.
There is my old friend!
My only companion all these long lonely years.
You let her save me,
That whistle actually worked.
Guilty about what?
That your quest would be in vain.
What?
Where is it?
With Luke,
Kronos promised me freedom,
That’s your brilliant idea?
That’s not true!
Someone’s coming!
There you are, my old friend.
Luke sends his compliments,
This was not part of our agreement,
No indeed,
Treachery.
Get used to it,
Nico,
Are you okay?
You were trying to help us?
I was tricked,
He tricked all of us.
Where’s Luke? Why isn’t he here?
Percy,
the wings. Do you think—
Get them,
I’ll try to buy you some time.
Kill the inventor! Kill him!
To me!
Spirits of the dead!
No!
You do not control me, young fool,
I am the son of Hades,
Be gone!
No.
I am.
Never!
I will not—
You will taste wonderful!
No…school…spirit…
We have to help Daedalus!
No time,
Too many coming!
Now you!
Daedalus!
Come on!
I won’t leave Mrs. O’Leary!
Go!
None of us know how to fly!
Great time to find out,
Yeah!
Land!
These wings won’t last forever.
How long?
I don’t want to find out!
The workshop moved,
There’s no telling where.
So what do we do now?
How do we get back in the maze?
No,
He isn’t dead.
How can you be sure?
I know when people die. It’s this feeling I get, like a buzzing in my ears.
What about Tyson and Grover, then?
We have to get into town,
We could just take a plane,
I don’t fly.
But you just did.
That was low flying,
So we need a car to take us into the city,
I’ll take care of it.
How?
Just trust me.
I’ll go with you,
I’m hungry.
I’ll stick with Rachel, then,
Meet you guys in the parking lot.
What are you going to do?
Just wait here,
Please.
I talked to Chiron,
The driver’s ready when we are,
Come on,
Where to, Miss Dare?
I’m not sure yet, Robert,
Whatever you say, miss.
Do you know this guy?
No.
But he dropped everything to help you. Why?
Just keep your eyes peeled,
Help me look.
Get off the highway!
Miss?
I saw something, I think. Get off here.
What did you see?
Western Museum of Mining & Industry.
There.
An old mine entrance.
A door to the Labyrinth?
How can you be sure?
Well, look at it!
I mean…I can see it, okay?
No!
No, really. Thanks, Robert. But we’re fine.
Have you seen this one,
Thanks for coming after us,
That’s what you were after all along,
You could be accepted,
You could have friends at camp.
Do you really believe that, Percy?
What is it?
Is it that way?
No,
Not at all.
Why are we stopping then?
Listen,
Eucalyptus trees,
Like in California.
There’s something evil down that tunnel,
And the smell of death,
Luke’s entrance,
I have to check it out,
Percy, no.
Luke could be right here,
Then we’ll all go.
No,
Percy, don’t,
Don’t go up there alone.
I’ll be quick,
I won’t do anything stupid.
Thanks.
Here goes nothing.
At least we salvaged the blade,
Yes! Yes!
Rewards beyond measure!
No, half-blood!
Gee, thanks,
Careful, fool,
Maybe I’ll let you unwrap it, then.
There!
We must sanctify it in blood,
What has happened!
Careful!
My lord,
Your symbol of power is remade.
You fool,
Whoa, what do you mean, he requires me?
Don’t be a coward!
No!
Ethan, don’t!
Trespasser!
Ethan,
don’t listen to them. Help me destroy it.
This body has been well prepared.
Don’t you think so, Percy Jackson?
Luke feared you,
Ah…much better,
What have you done to Luke?
Run, little hero,
Run!
PERCY!
Ow!
Luke?
What—
AFTER THEM!
No!
I can’t go any farther,
That sucked,
You saved our lives,
Nice that they trust me so much,
Nico…you, uh, kind of gave yourself away.
What do you mean?
Big deal.
No,
That can’t be true. He couldn’t—
He gave himself over to Kronos,
No!
You saw when Rachel hit him.
It was the only thing I had.
But you saw,
So maybe Kronos wasn’t completely settled in the body, or whatever,
It doesn’t mean Luke was in control.
You want him to be evil, is that it?
What is it with you?
Why do you keep defending him?
Whoa, you two,
Knock it off!
We have to keep moving,
He’ll send monsters after us.
You did good back there,
Yeah, well. I didn’t want you to die.
Hey, I’m sorry. We need to move.
I know,
I’m…I’m all right.
Back to New York,
Rachel, can you—
We have to follow them,
What about Camp Half-Blood?
There’s no time.
We have to find them,
They’re our friends.
Tyson!
Percy! Come quick!
What happened?
So many things,
Did he say anything?
He said, ‘We’re close.’ Then hit his head on rocks.
Grover,
Wake up.
Uhhhhhhhh.
Splurg!
Percy? Annabeth? Where…
It’s okay,
You passed out. The presence was too much for you.
I—I remember. Pan.
Yeah,
Something powerful is just beyond that doorway.
Anyway,
Come on, Grover. Lean on me.
I think we’re in Carlsbad Caverns,
Maybe an unexplored section.
How do you know?
Carlsbad is in New Mexico,
That would explain last winter.
Oh, wow.
Lord Pan!
I…got lost,
It’s a Small World.
You have a humming dodo bird,
Yes, that’s Dede. My little actress.
This is the most beautiful place!
I am glad you like it, dear,
My lord,
Chose?
I—I don’t understand.
I have slept many eons,
What?
But no! You’re right here!
My dear satyr,
But that wasn’t true!
Your kind never believed it,
No!
Dear Grover,
But gods can’t die,
They can fade,
Dede, what are you doing?
But…no!
Be strong,
Percy Jackson,
I know you believe you cannot make amends,
I—
I know you don’t believe this now,
My dear satyr,
will you carry my message?
I—I can’t.
You can,
I don’t want to.
I know,
Thank you, dear satyr. My final blessing.
Are…are you okay?
We should go now,
and tell them. The great god Pan is dead.
They’re beautiful!
Yeah,
Well,
I guess this is it.
Thanks, Rachel,
We couldn’t have done it without you.
I wouldn’t have missed it. I mean, except for almost dying, and Pan…
He said something about your father,
You mean…you’re rich?
Well, yeah.
Yes,
Hey, you can’t blame yourself for that.
No,
Uh, yeah. Sure.
I mean…I’d like that,
My number’s not in the book,
I’ve got it.
Still on your hand? No way.
No. I kinda…memorized it.
Go without me!
Nico,
we need your help.
Nico,
Please.
All right,
I feared as much,
Wait a moment,
What?
It’s true,
We were there when he died. All of us.
Impossible! You are all liars! Nature-destroyers!
We will speak of this later.
We will speak of it now!
We must deal with this—
Silenus,
Stay with me, Percy,
I saw Kronos,
How could he take over a mortal body?
Kronos said his body had been prepared.
Chiron, if he leads the attack—
Lock shields!
Fire!
GO!
Nico!
Serve me,
Hey!
Percy!
Thanks, Percy!
No problem!
Di Immortales!
This might be it,
Could be.
Nice fighting with you, Seaweed Brain.
Ditto.
Come on!
We need help!
Now!
Good girl!
Briares!
Hail, little brother!
Stand firm!
No!
Are you all right?
How embarrassing,
You need help,
I’ll get a medic from Apollo’s cabin.
No,
That was amazing,
I don’t know where it came from.
I do!
Percy, come quick! It is Nico!
Get some nectar!
Nico, what happened?
Can you talk?
Daedalus,
Yes, my boy,
I found the Hundred-Handed One as I came through the maze,
Yay!
Briares! I knew you would come!
I did not know,
Yes, my young architect,
My work is here,
Small compensation for the way I have acted,
Whoa,
Pass on? But you can’t just kill yourself. That’s wrong.
You won’t get a fair trial,
I will take what comes,
Yes,
Will you take my soul for ransom, then?
No,
Well done, son of Hades. You are becoming wise.
Then I am ready to see my son…and Perdix,
Come on,
We have work to do.
It was panic,
Panic?
Percy,
Preposterous!
That wasn’t it, sir,
A vote!
I would,
Miss me?
Well, I did not miss this place!
Strike that,
But, my lord,
It’s just nonsense!
Yes, sire!
We must exile the traitor!
I say no,
That is my vote.
I vote no as well,
All in favor of the exile?
Three to two,
Ah, yes,
Then let it be dissolved!
I don’t care.
Don’t worry,
Well,
Grover seems to be growing up.
Go left at the reef,
You’re giving him directions to the forges?
I want to see Cyclopes,
I doubt you’ll be lonely down there,
You helped him a lot.
I only talked to him.
He throws good rocks!
Saying good-bye,
We missed you at dinner,
You could’ve sat with me.
No.
I’m not staying, Percy.
But…you can’t just leave. It’s too dangerous out there for a lone halfblood. You need to train.
I train with the dead,
When will you go?
Makes sense,
But I hope we don’t have to be enemies.
By the way…
I don’t play that game anymore. It’s for kids.
It’s got four thousand attack power,
Five thousand,
Maybe it’s okay to still be a kid once in a while.
Thanks.
I’ve got a lot of things to investigate,
Keep in touch, Nico.
There goes a very troubled young man.
Walk with me,
Where to?
Just to the campfire,
Uh, thanks.
We have had many betrayals,
It was a group effort.
You cured him?
Madness is my specialty. It was quite simple.
But…you did something nice. Why?
Uh—
Why are you telling me this?
There’s a private school out there that I’ll be going to,
Yeah, well, call me, okay?
Sure,
I’ll keep my eyes open for…
Annabeth,
What was the rest of the prophecy?
You shall delve in the darkness of the endless maze,
You shall rise or fall by the ghost king’s hand,
Percy—
And lose a love to worse than death.
That was the last line, Percy. Are you happy now?
Oh,
You have nothing to apologize for, my dear.
Hera,
A success?
Our family is safe,
Oh, please.
Hephaestus was right,
Percy is right.
You will regret this insult, Annabeth. You will regret this very much.
I’m sorry,
I—I should get back. I’ll keep in touch.
Listen, Annabeth—
You’d better get going,
Take care, Seaweed Brain.
Yeah. It’s cool. I can’t wait.
You’ve had a rough summer,
How do you know that? Did my mom—
I mean, not close friends, but still—
I’m sorry.
Yeah. And, uh, I guess the girl stuff…
Here.
Percy, I kind of feel bad giving you one more thing to think about,
But I wanted to ask you something.
Yeah?
Girl stuff.
What do you mean?
Your mom,
I’m thinking about proposing to her.
You mean…marrying her? You and her?
Well, that was the genera idea. Would that be okay with you?
You’re asking my permission?
Man to man,
I think that’s a great idea, Paul. Go for it.
Cheers, Percy. Let’s join the party.
Who could that be?
Pos—
Um, hello.
Hello, Sally,
Yes
Help.
Hi, I’m Paul Blofis.
Ah, no. Blofis, actually.
Oh, I see,
Poseidon? That’s an interesting name.
Yes, I like it. I’ve gone by other names, but I do prefer Poseidon.
Like the god of the sea.
Very much like that, yes.
Well!
Ah.
I see.
There you are, my boy. And Tyson, hello, son!
Daddy!
Tyson is…
Not mine,
It’s a long story.
I couldn’t miss Percy’s fifteenth birthday,
That’s true,
I used to teach ancient history.
Are you all right, my boy?
Yeah. I’m fine. I guess.
I heard stories,
So Kronos is indeed back. It will not be long before full war is upon us.
What about Luke?
Is he really gone?
I don’t know, Percy. It is most disturbing.
But his body is mortal. Couldn’t you just destroy him?
The old sea gods?
Let me come down there,
Let me help.
Your birthday present. Spend it wisely.
Uh, spend a sand dollar?
What situation?
When the time comes,
I think you’ll know.
Dad,
He dedicated them to me,
Percy? The candles are melting!
You’d better go,
The eruptions are continuing,
I’m sorry,
I didn’t mean—
Nice plant,
Sorry,
Didn’t mean to startle you.
That’s—that’s okay. I mean…what are you doing here?
I’ve done some exploring,
You saw him?
That’s good.
What?
The way to beat Luke,
Okay. I’m listening.
Come inside for some cake and ice cream,
