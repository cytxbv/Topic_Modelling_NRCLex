MIIIIINE!
Percy, you’re going to be late
Come on, dear,
Coming,
Percy, are you all right?
Yeah … fine.
School, or …
I think Grover’s in trouble,
I wouldn’t be too worried, dear,
What is it?
Nothing,
Wait a minute,
I thought we were packing me up for camp tonight.
Ah, dear, about that … I got a message from Chiron last night.
What did he say?
He thinks … it might not be safe for you to come to camp just yet. We might have to postpone.
What problems?
Seven-thirty, dear. You should go. Tyson will be waiting.
Percy, we’ll talk this afternoon. Go on to school.
We’ll talk this afternoon, dear. I’ll explain … as much as I can.
progressive
You freak!
Why don’t you go back to your cardboard box!
Take it back, Sloan!
He’s not a freak. He’s just…
Just wait till PE, Jackson,
You are so dead.
I … I am a freak?
No,
Matt Sloan is the freak.
You are a good friend. Miss you next year if … if I can’t …
Don’t worry, big guy,
Everything’s going to be fine.
Hey!
Give it back!
These guys are moving here next year,
He’s not retarded.
You’re such a loser, Jackson. Good thing I’m gonna put you out of your misery next period.
Percy!
Percy?
Will you … uh …
Oh. Yeah.
Yeah, sure, man.
Coach, can I be captain?
Eh?
Yeah,
Mm-hmm.
Scared,
Smell funny.
What smells funny?
Them.
Smell funny.
I have to go potty!
Tyson,
Percy, duck!
Hey!
You could kill somebody!
I hope so, Perseus Jackson! I hope so!
Whoa! You’re not from Detroit! Who …
Let them go!
Coach!
Yeah. Mm-hmm,
Play nice.
Corey!
Run!
The other exit!
No one leaves unless you’re out!
And you’re not out until we eat you!
Flesh!
Hero flesh for lunch!
Percy needs help!
Tyson!
BAAAAAD!
My brothers!
You will pay for their destruction!
Tyson!
Look out!
Victory will be ours!
We will feast on your bones!
Move!
Away from the door.
No!
Well!
Stop!
It’s me you want!
You wish to die first, young hero?
My lunch approaches.
Ow,
And you,
Annabeth …
How did you … how long have you …
Pretty much all morning.
The shadow I saw this morning-that was-
There’s no time to explain!
There!
Meet me outside,
And him.
What?
No time!
Hurry!
Percy Jackson?
What … how …
Eh? Yeah. Mm-hmm.
Come on!
Where’d you find him?
He’s my friend,
Is he homeless?
What does that have to do with anything? He can hear you, you know. Why don’t you ask him?
He can talk?
I talk,
You are pretty.
Ah! Gross!
Tyson,
Your hands aren’t even burned.
Of course not,
Annabeth,
what are you talking about? Laistry-what?
Laistry-I can’t even say that. What would you call them in English?
Canadians,
The police’ll be after me.
That’s the least of our problems,
Have you been having the dreams?
The dreams … about Grover?
Grover? No, what about Grover?
Why? What were you dreaming about?
Camp,
Big trouble at camp.
My mom was saying the same thing! But what kind of trouble?
None all year … until today.
None? But how …
Oh.
What do you mean, ‘oh’?
Big guy,
Yes,
Yes,
Uh, well, Annabeth and I are half-bloods,
Yes.
So … you believe me?
But you are … Son of the Sea God?
Yeah,
My dad is Poseidon.
But then …
We don’t have time for this,
We’ll talk in the taxi.
A taxi all the way to camp?
Trust me.
What about Tyson?
We can’t just leave him,
He’ll be in trouble, too.
Yeah.
We definitely need to take him. Now come on.
Here.
I hope I have one left.
What are you looking for?
Found one. Thank the gods.
Annabeth,
New York taxi drivers won’t take that.
Stêthi,
Ô hárma diabolês!
Passage? Passage?
Three to Camp Half-Blood,
Ach!
We don’t take his kind!
Extra pay,
Three more drachma on arrival.
Done!
Long Island! Out-of-metro fare bonus! Ha!
Look out! Go left!
Well, if you’d give me the eye, Tempest, I could see that!
Wasp!
Give me the girl’s coin! I want to bite it.
You bit it last time, Anger!
It’s my turn!
Is not!
Red light!
Brake!
Excuse me,
But … can you see?
No!
No!
Of course!
They’re blind?
Not completely,
They have an eye.
One eye?
Yeah.
Each?
No. One eye total.
Not feeling so good.
Oh, man,
Hey,
Gray Sisters Taxi is the fastest way to camp.
Then why didn’t you take it from Virginia?
That’s outside their service area,
We’ve had famous people in this cab!
Jason! You remember him?
Don’t remind me!
Give me the tooth!
Only if Tempest gives me the eye!
No!
You had it yesterday!
But I’m driving, you old hag!
Excuses! Turn! That was your turn!
‘Ivit back! ‘Ivit back!
Uh, if anybody’s interested,
we’re going to die!
Don’t worry,
Yes, wise!
Every street in Manhattan!
The capital of Nepal!
The location you seek!
What?
Nothing!
You’re right, boy. It’s nothing!
Tell me.
No!
The last time we told, it was horrible!
Eye tossed in a lake!
Years to find it again!
And speaking of that-give it back!
No!
Eye!
Gimme!
I can’t see!
Give me the eye!
Give her the eye!
I don’t have it!
There, by your foot,
Don’t step on it! Get it!
I’m not picking that up!
Going to be sick!
Annabeth,
let Tyson use your backpack!
Are you crazy? Get the eye!
Nice boy!
Give it back!
Not until you explain,
What were you talking about, the location I seek?
No time!
Accelerating!
Percy,
First they have to tell me,
No!
Too dangerous!
I’m rolling down the window.
Wait!
30, 31, 75, 12!
What do you mean?
That makes no sense!
30, 31, 75, 12!
Percy!
Give them the eye now!
Whoa!
Better now.
All right,
Now tell me what those numbers mean.
No time!
We have to get out now.
Oh, man,
Border patrol, to me!
It’s Clarisse,
Come on, we have to help her.
to do
Tyson, stay here. I don’t want you taking any more chances.
No!
We need him.
Medea’s what?
Look, I don’t know what you’re talking about, but I’m not going to let Tyson get fried.
Tyson, stay back.
I’m going in.
Hold the line!
Behind you!
Look out!
Let me go!
Percy, curse you!
Tyson, help him!
Can’t-get-through!
I, Annabeth Chase, give you permission to enter camp!
Tyson!
BAD COW!
Down!
The other bull?
You-ruin-everything!
Good to see you too, Clarisse.
Argh!
Don’t ever, EVER try saving me again!
Clarisse,
you’ve got wounded campers.
I’ll be back,
You didn’t die.
I am sorry. Came to help. Disobeyed you.
My fault,
Let him cross the boundary line?’
Percy,
Tyson,
You’re a …
Cyclops,
One of the what?
They’re in almost all the big cities,
He’s a Cyclops.
Tantalus?
The activities director,
Chiron is the activities director. And where’s Argus? He’s head of security. He should be here.
That happened,
clean
Welcome back.
Whasthat!
The stables for pegasi,
The winged horses.
Whasthat!
Um … those are the toilets.
Whasthat!
You … have a cabin?
Number three.
You live with friends in the cabin?
No. No, just me.
Big Three
Big Three
Pony!
I beg your pardon?
Chiron, what’s happening? You’re not … leaving?
Clarisse said you were … you were …
Fired.
Besides himself, you mean,
But this is crazy!
Nevertheless,
some in Olympus do not trust me now, under the circumstances.
What circumstances?
Pony?
My dear young Cyclops! I am a centaur.
Chiron,
What about the tree? What happened?
Do not invoke the titan lord’s name, Percy. Especially not here, not now.
Perhaps,
Unless what?
No,
What is it?
We’ll go find it!
Why?
Overrun by monsters,
Keep him safe. The prophecy-remember it!
I-I will.
Um …
Right,
Just checking.
Chiron …
Swear you will do your best to keep Percy from danger,
I-I swear it upon the River Styx,
Very well,
Who is this Tantalus guy, anyway?
Where does he get off taking your job?
Go,
Stoll,
Who invited that?
Percy Jackson … sir.
Yes. Well, as you young people say these days: Whatever.
This boy,
you need to watch. Poseidon’s child, you know.
Ah!
That one.
I am Tantalus,
Trouble?
Yes, trouble,
Go on, then, old fellow,
Blast!
Ah, well,
Eventually,
You’re that spirit from the Fields of Punishment,
A real scholar, aren’t you, boy?
You must’ve done something really horrible when you were alive,
What was it?
I’ll be watching you, Percy Jackson,
I don’t want any problems at my camp.
Your camp has problems already … sir.
Oh, go sit down, Johnson,
Come on, Tyson.
Oh, no,
The monster stays here. We must decide what to do with it.
Him,
His name is Tyson.
Tyson saved the camp,
Yes,
and what a pity that would’ve been.
Leave us,
while we decide this creature’s fate.
I’ll be right over here, big guy,
I believe you. You are my friend.
Poseidon,
accept my offering.
Yes, well,
Another fine meal! Or so I am told.
And here on my first day of authority,
And now some changes!
Now I know,
Three deaths and twenty-six mutilations,
Yes, yes!
But, sir!
Ah, the hero of the day,
And modest, too.
And now,
Now, of course,
Come now,
Percy is my brother?
Aw, Tyson,
It’s not that simple.
He’s not my real brother!
He’s more like a halfbrother on the monstrous side of the family. Like … a half-brother twice removed, or something.
Oh sorry, eyes.
He’s not my brother!
And he’s not a monster, either!
Hey, don’t get mad at me! And technically, he is a monster.
Well you gave him permission to enter the camp.
Just forget it,
You’re treating him like he’s this horrible thing,
He saved my life.
Then maybe you should design a chariot with him.
Maybe I should.
Fine!
Fine!
chicken ponies,
You are mad?
Nah. I’m not mad.
I am a monster.
Don’t say that.
It is okay. I will be a good monster. Then you will not have to be mad.
It’s just… I never had a half-brother before.
I’m sorry,
Good night, big guy.
Thank the gods!
Percy?
I hear you,
Grover, what’s going on?
Honeypie! Are you done yet?
Not quite, dearest! A few more days!
Bah! Hasn’t it been two weeks yet?
N-no, dearest. Just five days. That leaves twelve more to go.
All right, but hurry! I want to SEEEEE under that veil, heh-heh-heh.
Where?
I don’t know exactly! I went to Florida and turned left.
It’s a trap!
Poly-who?
The Cyclops!
But he followed you,
That’s right,
Yes!
He thinks I’m a lady Cyclops and he wants to marry me!
I’ll come rescue you,
Where are you?
The Sea of Monsters, of course!
The sea of what?
Don’t tell me, I’ll die too.
Honeypie!
Dinnertime! Yummy yummy sheep meat!
I have to go. Hurry!
Wait! You said ‘it’ was here. What?
Sweet dreams. Don’t let me die!
Are you okay?
Right!
You’re trying to distract me,
What? No I’m not!
What do you mean?
Go back to your chariot, Percy.
I’m not making this up. He’s in trouble, Annabeth.
Percy, an empathy link is so hard to do. I mean, it’s more likely you really were dreaming.
The Oracle,
We could consult the Oracle.
Charioteers!
To your mark!
We’ll talk later,
after I win.
No hitting ponies with the stick,
No,
We will win.’
Charioteers!
Attend your mark!
See ya!
Sorry, Percy!
Nice work, Tyson!
Birds!
What?
Stymphalian birds!
They’ll strip everyone to bones if we don’t drive them away!
Tyson,
we’re turning around!
Going the wrong way?
Always,
Heroes, to arms!
Too many!
How do you get rid of them?
Percy … Chiron’s collection!
You think it’ll work?
To the Big House! It’s our only chance!
You’re running? The fight is here, cowards!
Everything’s under control! Not to worry.’
Now!
Archers!
Bravo!
We have our first winner!
And now to punish the troublemakers who disrupted this race.
If he’s really found it,
Hold on,
I’ll give you a hint. What do you get when you skin a ram?
Messy?
The Golden Fleece. Are you serious?
Yeah,
That old movie with the clay skeletons.
Oh my gods, Percy! You are so hopeless.
What?
It was probably important to her.
It could cure Thalia’s tree.
But Grover found it,
A little too perfect, don’t you think? What if it’s a trap?
What choice do we have?
Are you going to help me rescue Grover or not?
Percy,
Where’s that?
You mean the Mediterranean?
No. Well, yes … but no.
Another straight answer. Thanks.
Like Mount Olympus being above the Empire State Building,
Right.
The Bermuda Triangle?
Exactly.
Okay … so at least we know where to look.
Hey, I’m the son of the sea god. This is my home turf. How hard can it be?
Maybe.
Down by the Aegean,
I Am My Own Great-GreatGreat-Great-Grandpa,
This Land is Minos’s Land.
Well, that was lovely!
Sir,
Our kitchen boy has something to say?
We have an idea to save the camp.
Indeed,
The Golden Fleece,
We know where it is.
The Fleece can save the camp,
I’m certain of it.
Nonsense,
We don’t need saving.
Besides,
Yes, I would,
You would?
30, 31, 75, 12,
Ooo-kay,
Thank you for sharing those meaningless numbers.
They’re sailing coordinates,
Wait just a minute,
We need a quest! We need a quest!
It isn’t necessary!
WE NEED A QUEST! WE NEED A QUEST!
Fine!
You brats want me to assign a quest?
YES!
Very well,
I will allow our champion to consult the Oracle!
CLARISSE! CLARISSE!
Wait!
Grover is my friend. The dream came to me.
Sit down!
You had your chance last summer!
Yeah, he just wants to be in the spotlight again!
I accept the quest!
Silence, you brats!
Sit down!
And I will tell you a ghost story.
Once upon a time there was a mortal king who was beloved of the Gods!
This king,
Do you know what he did to his ungrateful children?
Oh, the gods punished him in the afterlife,
The Oracle, my dear. Go on.
Go!
What about you, Percy Jackson?
No comments from our dishwasher?
Good,
You will go anyway?
I don’t know,
It would be hard. Very hard.
I will help.
No. I-uh, I couldn’t ask you to do that, big guy. Too dangerous.
What are you building?
Oh, that’s not it,
Annabeth likes you. Really.
Daddy always cared for m-me,
Don’t talk that way! Poseidon claimed you, didn’t he? So … he must care about you … a lot….
Tyson … camp will be a good home for you. The others will get used to you. I promise.
Beautiful, aren’t they?
May I join you?
I haven’t sat down in ages.
Uh, sure.
Your hospitality does you credit. Oh, and Coca-Cola! May I?
Hello?
Yeah,
You have snakes on your phone.
What? Oh, they don’t bite. Say hello, George and Martha.
Oh, let’s not go into that again!
Uh, I like Hercules.
Why?
Well … because he had rotten luck. Even worse than mine. It makes me feel better.
Not because he was strong and famous and all that?
No.
You’re an interesting young man. And so, what now?
Not now,
Tell her to leave a message.
Just tell her I’m in a meeting!
Um … who are you, exactly?
Haven’t you guessed by now, a smart boy like you?
Original form, please.
You’re Luke’s father,
Hermes.
Behave, you two,
I-I don’t have permission to go.
No, indeed. Will that stop you?
I want to go. I have to save Grover.
I knew a boy once … oh, younger than you by far. A mere baby, really.
Did he get blasted to tiny pieces?
So what’s the moral?
The moral?
Um …
How about this: stealing is not always bad?
I don’t think my mom would like that moral.
I’ve got it,
You’re saying I should go anyway,
even without permission.
Martha, may I have the first package, please?
That’s Hercules,
Never question a gift,
Hercules Busts Heads?
Great show.
Wait a minute,
This is a gift?
One of two,
Go on, pick it up.
It’s a compass!
She’s always touching you,
You’re kidding,
Are those Minotaur-shaped?
How will I know if I really, really need it?
Um, thanks,
But Lord Hermes, why are you helping me?
You don’t mean … Luke?
Look,
You invented the Internet?
It was my idea!
I-I’m not sure.
You will some day.
And you, Percy,
I hope I packed well for you,
I do have some experience with travel.
Ship?
Wait,
I don’t understand any of this. I haven’t even agreed to go!
I’d make up your mind in the next five minutes, if I were you,
What’s going on?
I heard you calling for help!
Me, too!
Heard you yell, ‘Bad things are attacking!’
I didn’t call you guys,
I’m fine.
But then who …
Just listen,
We don’t have much time.
Percy,
we have to do the quest.
We’ll get expelled, you know. Trust me, I’m an expert at getting expelled.
So? If we fail, there won’t be any camp to come back to.
I want to go,
No!
We can’t leave him,
Tantalus will punish him for us being gone.
Percy,
Tyson can go,
if he wants to.
Want to!
All right,
How do we get to that ship?
Hermes said my father would help.
Well then, Seaweed Brain? What are you waiting for?
Urn, Dad?
How’s it going?
Percy!
We’re in a hurry!
We need your help,
Fish ponies!
Hippocampi!
They’re beautiful.
We’ll admire them later,
Come on!
There!
Tyson!
Grab a duffel bag!
Tyson!
Uh?
Come on!
Giddyup!
How do we get aboard?
You first,
Tyson, shhh!
Come on, big guy!
Can’t we take Rainbow?
Rainbow?
Um, we have to go,
Rainbow … well, he can’t climb ladders.
I will miss you, Rainbow!
Maybe we’ll see him again sometime,
Oh, please!
Tomorrow!
It’s a ghost ship,
No,
Bad smell.
I don’t smell anything.
Cyclopes are like satyrs,
They can smell monsters. Isn’t that right, Tyson?
Okay,
So what exactly do you smell?
Something bad,
Great,
That clears it up.
We need a hiding place,
Somewhere safe to sleep.
Sleep,
I’ll be next door,
You guys don’t drink or eat anything.
You think this place is enchanted?
I don’t know. Something isn’t right. Just … be careful.
Honeypie!
What are you doing?
Nothing!
Just weaving my bridal train, as you can see.
It hasn’t gotten any longer!
Oh, um, yes it has, dearest. See? I’ve added at least an inch.
Too many delays!
You smell good! Like goats!
Oh.
Do you like it? It’s Eau de Chevre. I wore it just for you.
Mmmm!
Good enough to eat!
Oh, you’re such a flirt!
No more delays!
But dear, I’m not done!
Tomorrow!
No, no. Ten more days.
Five!
Oh, well, seven then. If you insist.
Seven! That is less than five, right?
Certainly. Oh yes.
Hurry, Percy,
Please, please, please!
What did he say?
The happy man said … bowling practice?
Disemboweling practice?
Yes,
Good morning,
Percy, this is weird,
They’re all in some kind of trance.
Not hungry anymore,
Yesss,
He drawssss them. Ssssoon we will be sssstrong.
We have to get out of here.
You think I want to be in the girls’ restroom?
I mean the ship, Percy! We have to get off the ship.
Smells bad,
-only a matter of time. Don’t push me, Agrius!
I’m not pushing you!
It’ll pay off,
Leave now?
We can’t,
We have to find out what Luke is up to,
Nobody!
Please?
Hide!
You see that Aethiopian drakon in the cargo hold?
Yeah, it’s awesome.
I hear they got two more coming,
That was Chris Rodriguez!
Percy.
Look.
Scythian Dracaenae,
Dragon women.
Come on,
The sooner we find Luke the better.
Voices inside.
You can hear that far?
-the prophecy ourselves. The fools won’t know which way to turn.
Stop that, Tyson! How do you do that? It’s creepy.
Just listening.
Keep going,
What else are they saying?
Quiet!
Are you sure?
Yes,
Right outside.
Run!
Well,
If it isn’t my two favorite cousins. Come right in.
Well,
A little nicer than Cabin Eleven, huh?
Sit,
Where are my manners?
You don’t know Agrius and Oreius’s story?
For lunch,
Hehe! Hehe!
Shut up, you idiot!
Go punish yourself!
You poisoned Thalia’s tree.
Right to the point, eh? Okay, sure I poisoned the tree. So what?
How could you?
I didn’t dishonor her!
Liar!
I understand you want to destroy the camp!
You’re a monster!
Because you have none of your own!
Hey!
Traveling with a Cyclops,
Stop it!
Leave her alone,
And leave Tyson out this.
Oh, yeah, I heard. Your father claimed him.
Spies, you mean.
I know what I need to know,
Like, who my enemies are.
Then you’re a fool.
Percy is not a fool!
Too bad, Cyclops,
Luke,
Listen to me. Your father sent us.
Don’t-even- mention him.
Angry?
So?
He is re-forming,
That’s disgusting!
You’re insane,
Go to Tartarus,
A shame.
Ah, good, security,
I’m afraid we have some stowaways.
Yes, sir,
Hehe! Hehe!
Let me go, too,
Is no threat,
Agrius, stay here. We have important matters to discuss.
Oreius, don’t fail me. Stay in the hold to make sure the drakon is properly fed.
Now.
Ah!
We are not having a blast in the pool!
Stop him!
Lifeboat!
How do you launch this thing?
Get in!
Hold on!
Thermos!
What?
Hang on!
I am hanging on!
Tighter!
Percy,
What?
Curse my relatives!
Yeah, baby!
Woo-hoooooo!
-Miami,
That’s Virginia Beach!
Five hundred and thirty nautical miles,
How did you know that?
I-I’m not sure.
Percy, what’s our position?
36 degrees, 44 minutes north, 76 degrees, 2 minutes west,
Whoa. How did I know that?
Because of your dad,
Other boat is coming.
We can’t let them catch us,
They’ll ask too many questions.
Keep going into Chesapeake Bay,
I know a place we can hide.
There,
Past that sandbar.
Come on,
It’s just down the bank.
What is?
Just follow.
Not a good place,
Here.
A half-blood hideout.
Thalia and I,
And Luke.
So …
You don’t think Luke will look for us here?
Um, Tyson?
Convenience store?
Yeah, for snacks. Powdered donuts or something. Just don’t go too far.
Powdered donuts,
I will look for powdered donuts in the wilderness.
Here, donuts!
It’s not your fault.
He let us go too easily,
The Fleece is the bait? Or Grover?
What did he mean,
that Thalia would’ve been on his side?
He’s wrong.
You don’t sound sure.
Let’s go with ‘best friends.’
No.
Okay, then. Neither would she. Luke’s wrong.
So what did Luke mean about Cyclopes?
I know what he said. He … he was talking about the real reason Thalia died.
Powdered donuts!
Fifty feet,
Monster Donut shop-just over the hill!
This is bad,
This shouldn’t be here,
It’s wrong.
What?
It’s a donut shop.
Shhh!
Why are we whispering? Tyson went in and bought a dozen. Nothing happened to him.
He’s a monster.
A chain,
It could be a nest,
A nest for what?
Haven’t you ever wondered how franchise stores pop up so fast?
Um, no. Never thought about it.
What?
They breed what?
No-sudden-moves,
Very slowly, turn around.
Scatter!
Tyson!
Move!
No!
Percy!
You just opened another Monster Donut shop somewhere!
I’m about to die and you’re worried about that? How do we kill it?
Fire!
We have to have fire!
No hitting my friends!
What’s that noise?
Steam engine,
What?
There! Prepare the thirty-twopounder!
They’re too close, m’lady!
Damn the heroes!
Full steam ahead!
Aye, m’lady.
Fire at will, Captain!
Hit the dirt!
Gross!
Steamship!
Losers,
But I suppose I have to rescue you. Come aboard.
You are in so much trouble,
Tantalus expelled you for eternity,
Did they give you this ship?
‘Course not. My father did.
Ares?
Destroy anyone. I like that.
Clarisse,
Good! I’ll blow him out of the water.
You don’t understand,
No!
Where are your cabin mates?
They didn’t … I let them stay behind. To protect the camp.
You mean even the people in your own cabin wouldn’t help you?
Shut up, Prissy! I don’t need them! Or you!
Clarisse,
No! I don’t care what the Oracle-
What?
What did the Oracle tell you?
Nothing.
So we’re prisoners?
Guests. For now.
Aha!
Dear! I didn’t-you were so quiet!
Unraveling!
So that’s the problem!
Come!
Yes,
Put that on the spinning wheel!
Magic. Cannot be unraveled.
Oh … well …
Poor Honeypie!
Isn’t that … thoughtful of you!
Hehe.
But-but, dear,
what if someone were to rescue-I mean attack this island?
Pets?
And then,
they would have to get through me!
Now, come!
Back to the cave.
All hands on deck! Find Lady Clarisse! Where is that girl?
The entrance to what?
The Sea of Monsters, of course.
I don’t want excuses, little girl!
Y-yes, father,
You don’t want to see me mad, do you?
No, father.
No, father,
You’re pathetic. I should’ve let one of my sons take this quest.
I’ll succeed!
I’ll make you proud.
You’d better,
I DON’T CARE WHAT IT SAID!
You will succeed. And if you don’t …
Do we understand each other?
What’s wrong?
Another dream?
Too much strain on the pistons. Not meant for deep water.
Hurricane?
No,
Charybdis.
Are you crazy?
Only way into the Sea of Monsters. Straight between Charybdis and her sister Scylla.
What do you mean the only way?
The sea is wide open! Just sail around them.
What about the Clashing Rocks?
That’s another gateway. Jason used it.
I can’t blow apart rocks with my cannons,
Monsters, on the other hand …
You are crazy,
Watch and learn, Wise Girl.
Set course for Charybdis!
Aye, m’lady.
Clarisse,
Charybdis sucks up the sea. Isn’t that the story?
And spits it back out again, yeah.
What about Scylla?
Choose Scylla then,
Everybody goes below deck and we chug right past.
No!
You still have your thermos full of wind?
What about controlling the water?
You’re Poseidon’s son. You’ve done it before.
I-I can’t,
We need a backup plan,
This isn’t going to work.
Annabeth is right,
Engine’s no good.
What do you mean?
Pressure. Pistons need fixing.
Full reverse!
Boiler room overheating, ma’am! She’s going to blow!
Well, get down there and fix it!
Can’t!
We’re vaporizing in the heat.
We’re going in too fast,
Prepare yourself for death.
No!
I can fix it.
You?
He’s a Cyclops,
He’s immune to fire. And he knows mechanics.
Go!
Tyson, no!
It’s too dangerous!
Only way, brother.
I will fix it. Be right back.
Lady Clarisse,
Starboard and forward guns are in range!
Fire!
Again!
Tyson did it!
Wait!
We need to stay close!
We’ll die!
We have to move away.
The engine is about to blow!
Where’s Tyson?
Still down there,
We have to abandon ship.
No!
Scylla!
Everyone get below!
We can’t!
Below deck is in flames.
Lifeboats!
Quick!
They’ll never get clear of the cliffs,
We’ll all be eaten.
We have to try. Percy, the thermos.
I can’t leave Tyson!
We have to get the boats ready!
Get the other boat.
I’ll get Tyson.
You can’t!
The heat will kill you!
Tyson!
Rest,
You’re going to need it.
Tyson … ?
Percy, I’m really sorry.
He may have survived,
I mean, fire can’t kill him.
Yeah,
You can never trust a Cyclops.
Annabeth, what’s Chiron’s prophecy?
I know Chiron promised the gods he wouldn’t tell me. But you didn’t promise, did you?
Knowledge isn’t always good for you.
Your mom is the wisdom goddess!
I know! But every time heroes learn the future, they try to change it, and it never works.
The gods are worried about something I’ll do when I get older,
Why?
This kid in the prophecy … he or she couldn’t be like, a Cyclops?
The Oracle said ‘half-blood.’ That always means half-human, halfgod. There’s really nobody alive who it could be, except you.
Then why do the gods even let me live? It would be safer to kill me.
You’re right.
Thanks a lot.
Did the prophecy give any hints?
Land,
There’s land nearby!
Welcome!
Channel Five Fort Lauderdale
Is this your first time with us?
Umm …
First-time-at-spa,
Let’s see …
A what?
Right!
I guess it couldn’t hurt,
You okay?
You look pale.
I’m okay,
Just … let’s keep walking.
It’s beautiful.
You appreciate weaving, my dear?
Oh, yes, ma’am!
Oh, dear,
You do need my help.
Ma’am?
But …
What’s wrong with my hair?
Wasted?
Oh, definitely,
Well …
I suppose …
Right this way, dear,
There, there,
How about we try … this.
What do you see?
Whoa,
Do you want that?
No,
I can give you a full makeover,
What’s the catch?
I have to like … eat a special diet?
Oh, it’s quite easy,
One of these, substituted for a regular meal,
How is that possible?
Why question it? I mean, don’t you want the perfect you right away?
Why are there no guys at this spa?
Oh, but there are,
Now, Percy,
Your judgment.
What have you … what’s happening?
Don’t worry, Percy,
The pain will pass. Look! As I promised. Immediate results.
Reeet, reeet, reeet!
Perfect!
See, Percy? You’ve unlocked your true self!
Reeet, reeet, reeet!
A guinea pig,
Reeet!
None of that, little one,
Meet my discipline problems, Percy,
Miss C.C.?
Where’s Percy?
Your library is amazing!
Yes, indeed,
An architect?
Pah!
You, my dear, have the makings of a sorceress. Like me.
A sorceress?
Yes, my dear.
I-I don’t understand.
Stay with me,
You are too intelligent, my dear,
Bah! Men get all the glory.
You … C.C. … Circe!
Yes, my dear.
You need not worry. I mean you no harm.
What have you done to Percy?
Only helped him realize his true form.
Forget him,
Join me and learn the ways of sorcery.
Let me think about it,
Just… give me a minute alone. To say good-bye.
Of course, my dear,
One minute. Oh … and so you have absolute privacy …
Well,
how fast a minute passes. What is your answer, my dear?
This,
What will Annabeth’s makeover be?
How!
Turn Percy back to a human or else!
I can’t!
Then you asked for it.
No!
No!
You don’t understand! Those are the worst!
Argggh!
What’s the witch done t’me!
No!
I recognize you! Edward Teach, son of Ares?
Aye, lass,
Thanks …
I’m glad you’re not a guinea pig.
Me, too.
Come on, Seaweed Brain,
We have to get away while Circe’s distracted.
Which ship?
There,
I can make it work.
How?
Argggh!
We’ll never get going in time!
Mizzenmast!
One of the forges of Hephaestus,
Where he makes his metal monsters.
Like the bronze bulls?
Go around. Far around.
I guess you deserve to know,
Well, the worst wrong turn was into a Cyclops’s lair in Brooklyn.
They’ve got Cyclopes in Brooklyn?
What did you do?
I stabbed him in the foot.
Yeah, but still … that was pretty brave, Annabeth.
Go below,
You need some rest.
Well, Seaweed Brain?
Well?
Are we going to stop him or not?
Fine. Leave it to me and Aegis.
No,
No.
It can’t be.
No!
Ah!
Percy, you were having a nightmare. You need to get up.
Wh-what is it?
What’s wrong?
Land,
We’re approaching the island of the Sirens.
I want you to do me a favor,
No problem,
I want to hear them.
Why?
Don’t untie me,
Are you trying to tempt me?
Ha-ha.
Stay!
I’ll get us back to the ship,
It’s okay. Just hang on.
You okay?
I didn’t realize,
What?
I saw the way you rebuilt Manhattan,
And Luke and your parents.
You saw that?
That brown stuff they spread on veggie sandwiches?
No, Seaweed Brain. That’s hummus. Hubris is worse.
What could be worse than hummus?
You feel that way?
I’m listening.
Um … no. Me running the world would kind of be a nightmare.
Then you’re lucky. Hubris isn’t your fatal flaw.
What is?
So was it worth it?
Do you feel … wiser?
Percy.
monster island,
The Fleece,
If we take it away, will the island die?
It’ll fade. Go back to what it would be normally, whatever that is.
This is too easy,
We could just hike up there and take it?
There’s supposed be a guardian. A dragon or …
They’re like piranhas,
Percy!
Look.
Sorry,
S’okay,
Ugh,
Ouch,
Garrr!
You’re a feisty one!
Challenge me!
Give me back my sword and I’ll fight you!
Hmm,
Did you say bride?
Who- Grover?
Shut up. She has to shut up.
What ‘Grover’?
The satyr!
Oh!
What satyr?
Satyrs are good eating. You bring me a satyr?
No, you big idiot!
That satyr! Grover! The one in the wedding dress!
I don’t see very well,
Not since many years ago when the other hero stabbed me in eye. But YOU’RE-NO-LADYCYCLOPS!
Stop!
Don’t eat me raw! I-I have a good recipe!
Wait!
Recipe?
Grilled satyr with mango chutney,
You a satyr, too?
No, you overgrown pile of dung!
Rip my arms off,
And stuff them down your throat!
You got spunk.
Let me down!
But … you’re still getting married?
Who’s the bride?
Mangos,
What are mangos?
Trickery,
We can’t beat him by force, so we’ll have to use trickery.
Okay,
I haven’t figured that part out yet.
Great.
Polyphemus will have to move the rock to let the sheep inside.
At sunset,
I could get inside,
invisibly.
What about me?
The sheep,
How much do you like sheep?
Just don’t let go!
Oy! Goaties! Sheepies!
This is it!
I’ll be close by. Don’t worry.
Hasenpfeffer!
Hello, ugly!
Who said that?
Nobody!
Nobody!
I remember you!
You’re too stupid to remember anybody,
Much less Nobody.
Come here! Let me kill you, Nobody!
You can’t kill Nobody, you stupid oaf,
Come find me!
Nobody
It’s no good,
This rope is like iron!
Just a few more minutes!
Grover,
You’ve been working at it for hours!
Percy?
You’re supposed to be blown up!
Perrrrrcy!
You heard me! You came!
Yeah, buddy,
Of course I came.
Where’s Annabeth?
Outside,
But there’s no time to talk. Clarisse, hold still.
Thanks.
You’re welcome,
Now, was anyone else on board your lifeboat?
I got Nobody!
Hah!
I’ll rush him,
No way,
We’ll take him together,
Yeah,
All right,
Attack plan Macedonia.
Hey, Ugly!
Another one? Who are you?
Put down my friend. I’m the one who insulted you.
You are Nobody?
That’s right, you smelly bucket of nose drool!
RAAAR!
For Pan!
Get Annabeth!
Fall back!
Grind you into sheep chow!
A thousand curses on Nobody!
Faster!
Grover!
Get Annabeth’s knife!
Failed!
Nobody failed!
Uhhhhhhhh,
Percy!
Please, noooo!
Kill him!
What are you waiting for?
He’s a Cyclops!
Don’t trust him!
We only want the Fleece,
Will you agree to let us take it?
No!
Kill him!
I’m going to step back slowly,
One false move …
Foolish mortal!
Take my Fleece? Ha! I eat you first.
Bad Polyphemus,
Not all Cyclopes as nice as we look.
You thank the gods she is hurt?
No!
Which one?
In the tree!
The gold one!
Oh. Pretty. Yes.
No time! Throw it!
You’re not… married?
No. My friends talked me out of it.
Annabeth,
just lay still.
Down!
We have to go,
Our ship is…
Tyson,
can you lead the flock as far away as possible?
The sheep want food.
Come, sheepies! Um, people food this way!
Keep the Fleece around you,
Ohh. Not fully healed.
Ribs broken,
They’re mending, but definitely broken.
How can you tell?
Because I’ve broken a few, runt! I’ll have to carry her.
Incoming!
They probably won’t follow us into the water,
With Annabeth like this?
We can do it,
Once we get to the ship, we’re home free.
You’d think he’d run out of rocks,
Swim for it!
You, young Cyclops!
Traitor to your kind!
Don’t listen to him!
Come on.
I am not a traitor.
You serve mortals!
Thieving humans!
Not a traitor,
And you are not my kind.
Death or victory!
Percy!
Come on!
Go,
I will hold Big Ugly.
No! He’ll kill you.
Together,
Destroy you!
Fleece stealer!
You stole the Fleece!
You’ve been using it to lure satyrs to their deaths!
So? Satyrs good eating!
The Fleece should be used to heal! It belongs to the children of the gods!
I am a child of the gods!
Poseidon won’t curse me,
Humans not the same! Nasty, tricky, lying!
Young one!
Where are you? Help me!
You weren’t raised right!
Tyson!
No!
Blaaaaah!
Let him go,
Run.
I will smash you.’
Where are you?
Rarrr!
Yeah, yeah!
Clarisse!
Shut up!
Dive!
I did it! I finally sank Nobody!
Did it,
We …
You’re a genius,
Percy, wake up.
Miami, I think,
But the hippocampi are acting funny.
This is as far as they’ll take us,
June eighteenth! We’ve been away from camp ten days!
That’s impossible!
Thalia’s tree must be almost dead,
We have to get the Fleece back tonight.
How are we supposed to do that?
Percy’s fault?!
Stop it!
Clarisse,
what did the Oracle tell you exactly?
Ouch,
No,
No … wait a minute. I’ve got it.
Cash?
Like … green paper?
Yeah.
Like the kind in duffel bags?
Tyson!
Thought it was a feed bag for Rainbow,
Clarisse,
Come on. You’re going to the airport. Annabeth, give her the Fleece.
It’s your quest,
You can count on me. I won’t fail.
Not failing would be good.
Percy,
Generous?
Insane,
It’s her quest,
She deserves a chance.
Percy is nice,
Percy is too nice,
Come on,
Let’s find another way home.
Hey, cuz,
Welcome back to the States.
Percy,
What do you want, Luke?
Why, Percy,
I want to extend my hospitality, of course.
hospitality.
And so, the Fleece,
Where is it?
Hey!
That’s real goat fur under there!
Sorry, old friend.
Blaa-ha-ha!
Some old friend!
Maybe you didn’t hear me.
Where-is-the-Fleece?
Not here,
We sent it on ahead of us. You messed up.
You’re lying. You couldn’t have …
Clarisse?
You trusted … you gave …
Yeah.
Agrius!
Y-yes?
Get below and prepare my steed. Bring it to the deck. I need to fly to the Miami Airport, fast.’
Do it!
Or I’ll feed you to the drakon!
You’ve been toying with us all along,
Of course, you idiot! And you’ve messed everything up!
Traitor!
You tricked all of us!
Even DIONYSUS at CAMP HALF-BLOOD!
Who poisoned Thalia’s tree, Luke?
I did, of course,
Chiron had nothing to do with it?
Ha! You know he would never do that. The old fool wouldn’t have the guts.
You call it guts? Betraying your friends? Endangering the whole camp?
You were going to heal Kronos,
You know that! Why do you keep asking me?
Because I want everybody in the audience to hear you.
What audience?
Well,
some unplanned dinner entertainment.
Mr. D, you heard him,
I suppose not.
The Iris-message could be a trick,
I fear not,
I got it!
We are no longer in need of your services, Tantalus,
You may return to the Underworld. You are dismissed.
No! But-Nooooooooooo!
Kronos was right, Percy. You’re an unreliable weapon. You need to be replaced.
You’ll never leave this boat alive.
One on one,
What are you afraid of?
Sir!
Your steed is ready!
I told you last summer, Percy,
You can’t bait me into a fight.
And you keep avoiding one,
Scared your warriors will see you get whipped?
I’ll kill you quickly,
Luke,
at least give him a shield.
Sorry, Annabeth,
You bring your own equipment to this party.
My, Percy,
You’re out of practice.
Perrrrrcy!
One thing I want you to watch before you die, Percy.
He-he! He-he!
Brother!
Ponies!
Come get some!
Attack, you fools.’
Withdraw, brethren!
You won’t get away with this, horse man!
Dude, get your big friend!
Tyson!
Come on!
Dude!
Dude!
That was awesome! Head slam!
Chiron,
You saved us.
But how did you know where we were?
Gee, thanks,
No, no,
So what now?
But we got the Fleece!
Clarisse is on her way back to camp with it right now.
You’re coming, too?
Annabeth,
Sure, Chiron,
Come on, goat boy.
But I don’t like paintball.
Yes, you do.
It wasn’t her fault,
I made her tell me.
I suppose I could not expect to keep it secret forever.
So am I the one in the prophecy?
That’s what it meant,
That’s what what meant?
But there isn’t any other half-blood child of the Big Three!
That we know of.
And Kronos is rising. He’s going to destroy Mount Olympus!
He will try,
I’m just a kid, Chiron,
Celestial bronze, Percy. An immortal weapon. What would happen if you shot this at a human?
Nothing,
It would pass right through.
That’s right,
I … I don’t know.
You talk like you know him.
I do know him.
Indeed.
But, Chiron … I mean, come on! Why would they think you’d ever betray the camp for Kronos?
You, uh, owe Kronos a favor or something? He spared your life?
Percy,
The titan Kronos is my father.
really-big-lizardwith-breath-that-blows-stuff-up
What?
Nothing,
Just good to be home.
Hermes?
Hello, Percy. Didn’t recognize me without my jogging clothes?
Uh …
Oh, listen, Lord Hermes, about Luke …
Uh, we saw him, all right,
You weren’t able to talk sense into him?
Well, we kind of tried to kill each other in a duel to the death.
I see. You tried the diplomatic approach.
Do you ever feel your father abandoned you, Percy?
Only a few hundred times a day.
I tried to kill him.
You should get to bed,
A delivery?
I am the messenger of the gods, Percy.
Sign there, please.
Ah!
Oh, uh, sorry.
No …
Uh, we didn’t find any.
Good luck tomorrow,
What do you mean?
Enough, you two,
Good-bye, Percy. For now.
Here,
Thanks, man.
Didn’t finish in time for the trip,
Sorry, sorry.
Hey, man. No big deal.
If you need protection in race,
hit the button.
Ah, okay.
And, hey, um, Tyson …
I wanted to say, well …
I know what you will tell me,
He sent you to help me. Just what I asked for.
You asked Poseidon for … me?
For a friend,
But that’s so cruel!
The scars on your back?
Percy!
Come on!
Tyson …
Go,
You will win!
I-yeah, okay, big guy. We’ll win this one for you.
We’ve got ‘em!
Incoming!
You’re mine!
Yeah, right!
Can’t cut them.’
Switch with me!
Take the reins!
Trust me!
See ya, Percy!
Here’s a little parting gift!
Greek fire!
Get rid of it!
What?
Percy!
Hold up! Listen! It wasn’t just us!
Brother!
Tyson, my baby brother.
YMCA,
But, if I get in trouble again, you’ll be in danger, Percy! You could die!
YMCA
How did you manage that?
You just said that and they bought it?
I manipulated the Mist. Some day, when you’re ready, I’ll show how it’s done.
You mean, I can go back to Meriwether next year?
It’s high time you called her.
Percy-Jackson-what-were-you-thinking-do-you-have-anyidea-how-worried-I-was-sneaking-off-to-camp-without-permission-going-on-dangerous-quests-andscaring-me-half-to-death
Oh, I’m just glad you’re safe!
I’m sorry, Mom,
I won’t scare you again.
Don’t promise me that, Percy. You know very well it will only get worse.
I could come home for a while,
Yeah, of course. Uh, if there’s any school that will take me.
Oh, we’ll find something, dear,
Some place where they don’t know us yet.
Dream came from Daddy last night,
He wants me to visit.
An internship?
Yes.
When would you leave?
Now.
Now. Like … now now?
Now.
I’m happy for you, big guy,
Seriously.
Hard to leave my new brother,
You’ll make the best weapons ever,
Brothers help each other.
You’re my brother,
No doubt about it.
Use the shield well.
I will, big guy.
Save your life some day.
Hey, Percy.
Tyson …
He had to …
We know,
Chiron told us.
Cyclopes forges.
Come on, Seaweed Brain. Time for dinner.
Percy!
Annabeth … on the hill … she …
Is it true?
Curse the titan lord,
What do you mean?
The Fleece,
The Fleece did its work too well.
It healed the tree,
And poison was not the only thing it purged.
It’s true,
I can’t believe …
She needs nectar and ambrosia,
Come on!
I’m Percy,
You’re safe now.
Strangest dream …
It’s okay.
Dying.
No,
You’re okay. What’s your name?
I am Thalia,
Daughter of Zeus.
