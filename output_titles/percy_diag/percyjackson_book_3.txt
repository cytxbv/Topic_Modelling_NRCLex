Oh, yeah. This'll be fun.
Are you sure you don't want me to wait?
No, thanks, Mom,
I don't know how long it will take. We'll be okay.
But how will you get back? I'm worried, Percy.
It's okay, Ms. Jackson.
We'll keep him out of trouble.
All right, dears,
Do you have everything you need?
Yes, Ms. Jackson,
Thanks for the ride.
Extra sweaters? You have my cell phone number?
Mom—
Mom, seriously! We'll be fine. Come on, guys.
Your mom is so cool, Percy.
She's pretty okay,
ten.
If that was any of your business, Percy—
We'd better get inside,
Grover will be waiting.
Nothing good,
Whoa.
I wonder where—
Oo-kay,
Guess we'll stay awhile.
Well?
What are you doing here?
Um…
Ma'am, we're just—
Ha!
Oh, but we're not visitors, sir,
Ms. Gottschalk, do you know these students?
 She frowned at us. 
Oh, Mrs. Gottschalk. Dr. Thorn! I, uh—
What is it, Mr. Underwood?
What do you mean, they made it? These students live here.
Yes, ma'ams
Yes, sirs
How did you do that finger-snap thing?
You mean the Mist? Hasn't Chiron shown you how to do that yet?
That was close!
Thank the gods you got here!
So what's the emergency?
I found two.
Two half-bloods?
Here?
A brother and a sister,
Monsters?
 Grover looked nervous. 
Right,
These half-bloods are at the dance?
Then let's dance,
Who's the monster?
Oh,
There they are.
Bianca and Nico di Angela
Do they… I mean, have you told them?
smell
So let's grab them and get out of here,
Don't look at the kids,
How?
Dancing?
I did.
Oh my gods, Grover. That is so lame. Can't you play, like, Green Day or something?
Green who?
Never mind. Let's dance.
But I can't dance!
You can if I'm leading,
Come on, goat boy.
What?
Nothing. It's just cool to have Thalia back.
So…
 I said. 
Well, maybe, if I don't—
Hey!
Dance, you guys!
You look stupid just standing there.
Well?
Um, who should I ask?
Me, Seaweed Brain.
Oh. Oh, right.
I'm not going to bite,
What were you saying earlier?
It's not that. It's my dad.
Uh-oh.
So he wants you to move out there with him?
To the other side of the country,
What? Why not?
Oh,
So… you'll go back to living at camp or what?
It's more serious than that, Percy. I… I probably should tell you something.
They're gone.
What?
We have to get Thalia and Grover!
It's okay. I'm not going to hurt you.
My name's Percy,
Yes, Perseus Jackson
Thank you for coming out of the gym,
I hate middle school dances.
All three of you will come with me,
What are you doing, Jackson?
Keep moving!
It's my shoulder,
It burns.
Bah! My poison causes pain. It will not kill you. Walk!
There is a clearing ahead,
We will summon your ride.
What ride?
Where are you taking us?
Silence, you insufferable girl!
Don't talk to my sister that way.'
Halt,
Thanks,
What is he?
How do we fight him?
I… I'm working on it.
I'm scared,
Stop talking!
Face me!
The package—it is ready to deliver.
What did he call you?
I'll explain later,
You do have a plan, right?
I would kill you before you ever reached the water,
You do not realize who I am, do you?
Unfortunately,
Who wants us?
 Her voice broke a little. 
Aww,
Luke,
You work for Luke.
The General?
Ah, here we are. Your transportation.
Where are you taking us?
They're not dolls! They're figurines! And you can take your great army and—
Now, now,
The Great what?
The stirring of monsters.
Okay,
He's completely nuts.
We have to jump off the cliff,
Into the sea.
Oh, super idea. You're completely nuts, too.
For Zeus!
A manticore!
Who are you people?
And what is that?
A manticore?
Get down!
Yield!
Never!
No!
Now do you see how hopeless it is? Yield, little heroes.
No,
It cannot be—
Curse you!
The Hunters!
Oh, wonderful.
Not so,
 She looked at the older girl with the circlet. 
If I cannot have these alive, I shall have them dead!
No.'
Get back, half-blood!
Get out of the line of fire!
Fire!
No!
Annabeth!
Mortals,
are not allowed to witness my hunt.
You,
Zoe Nightshade.
Perfect timing, as usual.
Four half-bloods and a satyr, my lady.
Yes,
Some of Chiron's campers, I see.
Annabeth!
You have to let us save her!
You are in no condition to be hurling yourself off cliffs,
Let me go!
Who do you think you are?
No,
 she said. 
Um… okay.
Thank you, Lady Artemis! You're so… you're so… Wow!
Get up, goat boy!
Whoa,
Hold up. Time out.
Who… who are you people?
 Bianca said. 
What?
I'm telling the truth.
You are a half-blood,
An Olympian… athlete?
No,
One of the gods.
Cool!
No!
This is not cool!
Nico, shut up!
Dangerous,
like the girl who fell.
Do not despair for Annabeth,
Then why won't you let us go look for her?
Oo!
He was a manticore,
Or they'll hunt us,
And that bus driver,
That's why Grover has been watching you,
Grover?
You're a demigod?
Well, a satyr, actually.
Grover, put your shoes back on,
You're freaking her out.
Hey, my hooves are clean!
Bianca,
Camp?
Camp Half-Blood,
Sweet, let's go!
Wait,
I don't—
There is another option,
No, there isn't!
We've burdened these children enough,
Yes, my lady.
And, Bianca, come with me. I would like to speak with you.
What about me?
You bet! Come on, Nico!
I'm with you,
I don't trust—
Oh, you're with me?
It's green!
Hold still,
Here, eat some ambrosia while I clean that out.
Big collection,
You've been playing this game a long time?
Just this year. Before that…
What?
I forget. That's weird.
Hey, can I see that sword you were using?
Cool! Does it ever run out of ink?
Um, well, I don't actually write with it.
Are you really the son of Poseidon?
Well, yeah.
Can you surf really well, then?
Jeez, Nico,
I've never really tried.
Percy Jackson.
Yes, ma'am.
Come with me,
Lady Artemis wishes to speak with thee.
Join us, Percy Jackson,
Are you surprised by my age?
Uh… a little.
Go astray?
Oh.
You must forgive my Hunters if they do not welcome you,
 She looked at Zoe. 
That boy in Colorado,
You turned him into a jackalope.
Ah, yes.
The scent, my lady?
Yes.
What scent?
Things are stirring that I have not hunted in millennia,
Um, 'I hate middle school dances.'
No, no. After that.
He said somebody called the General was going to explain things to me.
Go on, Percy,
Well, then Thorn was talking about the Great Stir Pot—
Stirring,
Maybe he was lying,
No, Zoe. I must do this alone.
But, Artemis—
As… as you wish, my lady.
 Artemis vowed. 
You know what the monster is?
Let us pray I am wrong.
Can goddesses pray?
Does it involve getting turned into a jackalope?
What?
Yes, I know,
And now there is one last decision to make.
I'm still thinking about it.
Wait,
Thinking about what?
They… they've invited me to join the Hunt.
It is not the only way for a girl,
To begin with,
immortality.
She's kidding, right?
Zoe rarely kids about anything,
What oath?
To foreswear romantic love forever,
Like you?
Not just half-bloods,
Which are you, then?
Bianca, this is crazy,
What about your brother? Nico can't be a Hunter.
Certainly not,
Hey!
You can see him from time to time,
A new family,
Free of responsibility.
Bianca, you can't do this,
It's nuts.
Is it worth it?
It is.
What do I have to do?
Say this,
 'I pledge myself to the goddess Artemis.'
I… I pledge myself to the goddess Artemis.
That's it?
If Lady Artemis accepts thy pledge, then it is binding.
I accept it,
I feel… stronger.
Welcome, sister,
Remember your pledge,
It is now your life.
Do not despair, Percy Jackson,
Great,
How are we supposed to get there?
So,
We're going to get a ride from your brother, huh?
Percy Jackson,
How'd they even show up here?
And Bianca joined them,
Who can blame her?
Eternity with Artemis?
But she's so… into nature,
You're nuts,
Nuts and berries,
Yeah.
You're, um, waiting for sunrise?
For my brother. Yes.
It's not exactly as you think,
Oh, okay.
So, it's not like he'll be pulling up in a—
Don't look,
Not until he parks.
Wow,
Apollo is hot.
He's the sun god,
That's not what I meant.
Little sister!
What's up? You never call. You never write. I was getting worried!
I'm fine, Apollo. And I am not your little sister.
Hey, I was born first.
We're twins! How many millennia do we have to argue—
So what's up?
Sure, sis!
That last line was only four syllables,
Was it?
Yes. What about I am so big-headed?
No, no, that's six syllables. Hmm.
I've got it!
I am so awesome. That's five syllables!
These demigods will also need a ride,
No problem!
Hi, Lord Apollo.
Brother,
You should get going.
Oh, right.
Percy Jackson?
Yeah. I mean… yes, sir.
sir,
Well!
Cool car,
Thanks, kid,
But how will we all fit?
Oh.
Right,
Everybody in.
Here, sweetheart. Let me get that.
Brother,
Sorry. I forgot. Hey, sis, where are you off to, anyway?
Hunting,
It's none of your business.
I'll find out. I see all. Know all.
Just drop them off, Apollo. And no messing around!
No, no! I never mess around.
Yes, my lady.
So much danger. The beast must be found.
So,
This is so cool!
Downsizing,
But how does it work?
I thought the sun was a big fiery ball of gas!
No.
Well then, just think of it as a really powerful, really dangerous solar car.
Can I drive?
No. Too young.
Oo! Oo!
Mm, no,
Too furry.
Daughter of Zeus!
Lord of the sky. Perfect.
Oh, no.
No, thanks.
C'mon,
How old are you?
I don't know.
You're fifteen, almost sixteen.
How do you know that?
Hey, I'm the god of prophecy. I know stuff. You'll turn sixteen in about a week.
That's my birthday! December twenty-second.
Which means you're old enough now to drive with a learner's permit!
Uh—
I know what you're going to say,
That's not what I was going to say.
no
Take it away!
You're gonna be a natural!
Speed equals heat,
What's wrong?
Nothing,
N-nothing is wrong.
Ow
Sorry.
Slower!
Sorry!
I've got it under control!
Thalia,
lighten up on the accelerator.
I've got it, Percy,
Loosen up,
I'm loose!
We need to veer south for Long Island,
Hang a left.
The other left,
Ah…
Take the wheel!
No worries,
Pull up!
There!
I'm under control,
I'm under control.
Brake,
I can do this.
BRAKE!
Well,
Whoa,
Is that a climbing wall?
Yeah,
Why is there lava pouring down it?
Little extra challenge. Come on. I'll introduce you to Chiron. Zoe, have you met—
I know Chiron,
I'll show you the way,
We know the way.
Oh, really, it's no trouble. It's easy to get lost here, if you don't
like my old daddy goat used to say! Come on!
Take care, sweethearts!
What do you mean?
Later, Thalia,
Who's Chiron?
I don't have his figurine.
Our activities director,
If those Hunter girls don't like him,
Percy! Thalia! Ah, and this must be—
Nico di Angelo,
He and his sister are half-bloods.
You succeeded, then.
Well…
What's wrong? And where is Annabeth?
Oh, dear,
Not another one lost.
What do you mean?
Who else is lost?
The Hunters are all moved in!
The Hunters, eh? I see we have much to talk about.
But… Oh, right. Yes, sir.
Orientation film?
Is it G or PG? 'Cause Bianca is kinda strict—
It's PG-13,
Cool!
Now,
I'll go,
Certainly not!
From what you have told me,
Annabeth,
Yes, yes,
Annabeth may be alive,
That's right,
Luke would want her alive.
In which case
Percy.
You're glad to lose another camper,
You'd like it if we all disappeared!
You have a point?
Yeah,
SO COOL!
You're… you're a centaur!
And, whoa!
You're the wine dude? No way!
Dionysus, right? Oh, wow! I've got your figurine.
My figurine.
Ah.
Percy,
Capture the flag?
But we don't have enough—
It is a tradition,
A friendly match, whenever the Hunters visit.
Yeah,
I bet it's real friendly.
Run along now,
Oh, right,
Come on, Percy.
You've already got Ares on your bad side,
You need another immortal enemy?
Sorry,
I couldn't help it. It's just so unfair.
Percy, everything is unfair,
Sometimes I wish…
We'll get Annabeth back,
I just don't know how yet.
First I found out that Luke is lost,
Now Annabeth—
Don't think like that.
You're right.
We'll find a way.
I'll break that up,
All right. You should be team captain.
No, no,
You've been at camp longer. You do it.
We can, uh… co-captain or something.
Hey, Thalia.
Yeah?
I'm sorry about what happened at Westover. I should've waited for you guys.
S okay, Percy. I probably would've done the same thing.
I'm sorry.
That's why you had trouble with the sun van.
What do you mean?
Yeah,
Yeah, that must've been it.
Went on a quest for Chiron. Top secret!
Is she okay?
Thanks, Dad.
Iris, O Goddess of the Rainbow,
accept my offering.
good son
Show me Tyson,
At the forges of the Cyclopes.
Tyson!
TYSON!
Percy!
Tyson, it's an Iris-message. I'm not really here.
Oh.
Oh, I knew that. Yes.
How are you?
How's the job?
Love the job! Look!
I made this!
That's really cool.
I wrote my name on it. Right there.
Awesome. Listen, do you talk to Dad much?
Not much. Daddy is busy. He is worried about the war.
What do you mean?
Is there anything I can do?
 He looked at his sword blade and sighed. 
The Princess Andromeda?
Luke's boat?
Smashing it would be good.
Annabeth! Is she there?
Oh, well…
Well, no… she's not here right now.
Tell her hello!
Hello to Annabeth!
Okay.
I'll do that.
And, Percy, don't worry about the bad boat. It is going away.
What do you mean?
Panama Canal! Very far away.
All right,
That's… good. I guess.
Got to get back to work! Boss will get mad. Good luck, Brother!
Okay, tell Dad—
good will
Thorn!
Where are you? Why did you bring me here?
Annabeth!
Help me! Please!
What happened?
They left me here,
Please. It's killing me.
Why should I trust you?
You shouldn't,
I've been terrible to you. But if you don't help me, I'll die.
Thanks,
Help me hold it,
I knew I could count on you.
HELP ME!
Oh, don't worry,
A cave ceiling collapsed on her?
Yeah. What the heck does that mean?
I don't know. But after what Zoe dreamed—
Whoa. What do you mean? Zoe had a dream like that?
Wait, how do you know this?
I was sort of camped outside the Artemis cabin.
What for?
Just to be, you know, near them.
You're a stalker with hooves.
What did she say?
Whoa, wait. How could Artemis be in trouble?
I… well, finally Chiron came out in his pajamas and his horse tail in curlers and—
He wears curlers in his tail?
Sorry,
Go on.
 Grover gulped. 
What do you mean lost? Like she needs directions?
No. I think she meant gone. Taken. Kidnapped.
Kidnapped?
Well, yeah. I mean, it happened to Persephone.
But she was like, the goddess of flowers.
Springtime.
I don't know. Kronos?
He can't be that powerful already. Can he?
I don't know,
They're connected,
Ah, love,
I've got to talk to Zoe,
Um, before you do…
Scouting us? What do you mean?
I found that in Annabeth's backpack,
I don't understand.
Well, it seems to me… maybe Annabeth was thinking about joining.
Hi,
Uh, what's up?
up
I have a question,
All right,
Fine. I'll figure it out myself.
I'll show them 'love is worthless,'
I'll pulverize them!
I'll take the offense,
You take defense.
Oh.
Don't you think with your shield and all, you'd be better defense?
Well, I was thinking it would make better offense,
Yeah, no problem,
Cool.
Percy, this is awesome!
Do we get to kill the other team?
Well… no.
But the Hunters are immortal, right?
That's only if they don't fall in battle. Besides—
Nico, this is serious. Real swords. These can hurt.
Heroes!
Sweet,
What kind of magic items? Do I get one?
Blue team! Follow me!
We'll send out a decoy to the left,
Silena, you lead that.
Got it!
Anything to add, Percy?
And don't leave your post!
Unless you see a golden opportunity,
Just don't leave your post.
Right, unless—
Percy!
Sorry,
What's happening?
Can you guys hold the fort?
Of course.
Sorry!
Percy!
What are you doing?
No fair!
Fart arrows are unsportsmanlike!
No!
The Hunters win!
Perseus Jackson!
What in the name of the gods were you THINKING?
I got the flag, Thalia!
I saw a chance and I took it!
I WAS AT THEIR BASE!
You had too many on you!
Oh, so it's my fault?
I didn't say that.
Argh!
Sorry!
I didn't mean to—
Yeah,
I didn't mean to, either.
Enough!
You want some, Seaweed Brain?
Bring it on, Pinecone Face!
Thalia!
That is enough!
Percy!
This is impossible,
What must I do to help my goddess?
Watch her head!
Ah, man.
Did I break anything?
I can't tell,
Well,
that was gross.
What will Chiron do?
I wish I knew.
I want to be out there.
Searching for Annabeth?
Why?
What were you thinking?
You mean Pan.
I've let the trail go cold,
Tell Percy to get his butt downstairs.
Why?
Did he say something?
Um, he asked why.
Dionysus is calling a council of cabin leaders to discuss the prophecy,
Unfortunately, that includes Percy.
This is pointless.
Cheez Whiz!
There is no time for talk,
And go where?
West!
Yes,
Artemis is being held hostage! We must find her and free her.
You're missing something, as usual,
No!
The Hunters do not need thy help.
Your
Forget it.
I fear the prophecy says you do need our help,
Or do they?
Mr. D,
with all due respect, whose side are you on?
Sorry, my dear centaur. Just trying to be helpful.
We're supposed to work together,
We must not delay,
Oh, joy,
Another dull annual meeting.
Artemis must be present at the solstice,
Are you suggesting that the gods have trouble acting together, young lady?
Yes, Lord Dionysus.
Just checking. You're right, of course. Carry on.
I must agree with Zoe,
Three and two,
We're supposed to have five,
Well,
It does make sense.
I would prefer to take all the Hunters. We will need strength of numbers.
You'll be retracing the goddess's path,
Chiron,
you don't have any ideas about the monster?
That's some serious danger you're facing,
It sounds like at least two of the five are going to die.
One shall be lost in the land without rain
And the Titan's curse must one withstand,
What could that mean?
One shall perish by a parent's hand,
How is that possible? Whose parent would kill them?
There will be deaths,
That much we know.
Oh, goody!
Ah, pinot noir is making a comeback. Don't mind me.
Percy is right,
Two campers should go.
Oh, I see,
And I suppose you wish to volunteer?
I'm not going anywhere with the Hunters. Don't look at me!
A daughter of Aphrodite does not wish to be looked at,
Stop it,
I shall go, of course, and I will take Phoebe. She is our best tracker.
The big girl who likes to hit people on the head?
The one who put the arrows in my helmet?
Yes,
Why?
Oh, nothing,
Just that we have a T-shirt for her from the camp store.
Me? But… I'm so new. I wouldn't be any good.
You will do fine,
There is no better way to prove thyself.
And for campers?
Me!
Anything to help Artemis!
I think not, satyr. You are not even a half-blood.
But he is a camper,
Absolutely!
Very well,
And the second camper?
I'll go.
Whoa, wait a sec,
Oh,
He cannot,
He is a boy. I won't have Hunters traveling with a boy.
You traveled here with me,
What about Grover?
He does not count. He's a satyr. He is not technically a boy.
Hey!
I have to go,
I need to be on this quest.
Why?
Because of thy friend Annabeth?
No,
So be it,
—he glanced at Dionysus—
Percy, I'm so sorry!
It's okay,
Really. It's fine.
Grover,
perhaps you'd let me have a word with Percy?
Sure,
Oh,
You mean alone. Sure, Chiron.
Yeah,
Well, maybe that's because they don't make any sense.
Would you have chosen me?
Frankly, no,
You and Thalia are much alike.
Thanks a lot.
We could handle it.
The way you handled it at the creek tonight?
Perhaps it is for the best,
Yeah,
Maybe.
One shall perish by a parent's hand. Yeah.
Chiron,
You know what this Titan's curse is, don't you?
O goddess, accept my offering.
Show me Sally Jackson,
Upper East Side, Manhattan.
Sally, you're a riot. You want some more wine?
Ah, I shouldn't. You go ahead if you want.
Actually, I'd better use your bathroom. May I?
Down the hall,
Mom!
Percy! Oh, honey! Is everything okay?
What are you doing?
Homework.
Mr. Blowfish?
Blofis. He'll be back in a minute, Percy. Tell me what's wrong.
Oh, Percy…
Yeah. So they tell me there's nothing I can do. I guess I'll be coming home.
—she sighed like she was mad at herself—
What do you mean?
You're… you're telling me to go?
Mom—
I don't have much time,
How can you be sure?
Because she'd do the same for you.
How is our mortal guest?
She's fading. We must hurry.
You heard the boy,
Decide!
How dare you torture a maiden like this!
She will die soon,
You can save her.
Free my hands,
You surprised me,
Indeed it will not,
You know nothing of mercy, you swine.
On that,
we can agree. Luke, you may kill the girl now.
No!'
She—she may yet be useful, sir.. Further bait.
Bah! You truly believe that?
Yes, General. They will come for her. I'm sure.
You will never find the monster you seek,
Your plan will fail.
How little you know, my young goddess,
Hello?
Blackjack,
It's the middle of the night!
How many times have I told you? Don't call me boss.
Blackjack,
you're supposed to stay in the stables.
Well… no.
Again?
All right,
I'm coming.
And don't call me boss!
Thanks.
Mooooooo!
Whoa, little one,
Where did you come from?
Moooo!
Yeah,
So I've heard.
Whoa!
I'm not going to hurt you! Just let me cut the net.
Okay, okay!
Yeah,
I got that part. I'm thinking.
she
All right,
I need all of you to push exactly the way I tell you.
It's okay, Bessie,
Good cow. Nice cow.
Moooo!
Yeah,
That's okay. Nice cow. Well… stay out of trouble.
Yeah. We rescued a baby… something or other. Took forever. Almost got stampeded.
Blackjack,
set me down over there, will you? Behind that column.
It cannot be cured,
Not quickly, at any rate.
But how did it happen?
A foolish prank,
That's terrible!
She will live,
But the prophecy,
There is no time,
In the land without rain,
but that can't be here.
It might be,
But—
Bianca, hear me.
You should tell Thalia the rest of your dream.
No. It would not help.
But if your suspicions are correct, about the General—
I have thy word not to talk about that,
Wait.
I've been here the whole time. Invisible.
Wow. Cool.
How did you know Zoe and your sister were here?
And now you're thinking about following them on the quest,
How did you know that?
Because if it was my sister, I'd probably be thinking the same thing. But you can't.
Because I'm too young?
Say what?
You can turn invisible. You can go!
The Hunters don't like boys,
If they find out—
Nico—
You're planning to go anyway, aren't you?
Yeah,
I have to find Annabeth. I have to help, even if they don't want me to.
I won't tell on you,
But you have to promise to keep my sister safe.
Promise,
I'll do my best. I promise that.
Get going, then!
Good luck!
Tell Chiron—
I'll make something up.
I'm good at that. Go on!
Yeah. Let's fly.
Where's Argus taking them?
Which girl?
Zoe?
Well,
Lets get after them.
Going somewhere?
Mr. D.
What do you want?
Well… maybe.
You're a hero, boy. I need no other reason.
Did I ever tell you about Ariadne?
They got married,
Happily ever after. The end.
That's wrong,
What do you mean, ask Zoe?
Go. Follow your silly friends.
You're… you're letting me go? Just like that?
Come on, Blackjack,
Stay here,
I'm going to scout.
Grover, are you sure?
Well… pretty sure. Ninety-nine percent. Okay, eighty-five percent.
And you did this with acorns?
D.C. is about sixty miles from here,
Nico and I…
I dislike this,
We should go straight west. The prophecy said west.
Oh, like your tracking skills are better?
Oh, scullion You're calling me a scullion? What the heck is a scullion?
Whoa, you two,
Come on. Not again!
Grover's right,
D.C. is our best bet.
You're going to get us arrested, driving,
Perhaps,
You okay?
You don't sound so good.
Set me down there,
That's close enough.
You've done enough already,
I'll be fine. And thanks a ton.
Well?
I know that, you fool,
But where?
In the rocket museum.
The Air and Space Museum,
As you say, sir
How many?
How many?
Four, General,
Thalia,
And two other girls—Hunters. One wears a silver circlet.
That one I know,
Let me take them,
We have more than enough—
Patience,
But—
We cannot risk you, my boy.
Yes, boy,
No.
You have already failed me, Thorn,
But, General—
No excuses!
I should throw you into the pits of Tartarus for your incompetence,
But you promised me revenge.'
A command of my own!
I am Lord Kronos's senior commander,
Now, my boy.
The Hunters will be difficult to dispose of,
Zoe Nightshade—
Do not speak her name!
S—sorry, General. I just—
Do you have the teeth?
Yes, General!
Plant them,
Ready, General!
Excellent! Water them, and we will let them scent their prey.
Soon,
Ha.'
Mew?
You.'
Get me the right teeth. NOW!
This is why I don't use mortals,
They are unreliable.
They are weak-minded, easily bought, and violent,
I love them.
Excellent,
Curse my stiff neck.
Another hot pad, sir?
More Tylenol?
No! It will pass.
Quickly, do you have the scent?
Yesssss, lord,
Excellent,
What's this?
An intruder,
One cloaked in darkness. Seal the doors!
It's Percy Jackson!
It has to be.
Percy!
Thank goodness.
I mean, um, gosh. You're not supposed to be here!
Luke,
He's here.
Where?
The General is here?
That is impossible! You lie.
Why would I lie? Look, there's no time. Skeleton warriors—
What?
How many?
Twelve,
We were following Artemis's trail,
Zoe,
if it is the General—
It cannot be!
Illusions don't crack marble floors,
 she said, 
Good idea,
I was not including thee, boy,
You are not part of this quest.
Hey, I'm trying to save your lives!
You shouldn't have come, Percy,
That is not thy decision!
You never had any wisdom when it came to boys,
Kitty!
The Nemean Lion,
Don't move.
Separate on my mark,
Try to keep it distracted.
Until when?
Until I think of a way to kill it. Go!
ROOOAAAR!
Hi-yah!
Back!
Hey!
Zoe!
Target the mouth!
Grover!
Clear the area!
No clear shot!
Get it to open its mouth more!
Thalia,
keep it occupied.
Hi-yah!
ROOOOOOOAR!
This is no time for souvenirs, boy!
Percy,
whatever you're going to do—
Hey!
Zoe, get ready!
Snack time!
Now!
That was… an interesting strategy.
Hey, it worked.
Take it,
It is a spoil of war,
It is rightly thine.
You killed it,
Not exactly my style,
We have to get out of here,
You did that?
The security guards are not our biggest worry,
Look.
Go,
They'll be hunting me. I'll distract them.
No,
We go together.
But, you said—
You are part of this quest now,
They know the van,
We have to ditch it.
Maybe the military will shoot it down,
The military probably thinks it's one of theirs,
Mercenaries,
But don't these mortals see who they're working for?
There!
That parking lot!
We'll be trapped,
Trust me,
Subway entrance,
Let's go south. Alexandria.
Anything,
Nice job, Bianca, thinking of the subway.
New? But that station looked really old.
I guess,
Wait a minute. No subway at all?
Bianca,
How long ago…
We need to change trains,
Next station.
Well this is g-g-ggreat.
My hooves are frozen,
Feet,
Maybe we should contact camp,
Chiron—
No,
They cannot help us anymore. We must finish this quest ourselves.
You know,
you're never completely without friends.
Yes, sir,
You know of any?
That's… convenient,
Thanks, uh…
Join you?
Nice coat,
Not even close. We've got a long way to go.
He said that?
Well, something like that. Yeah.
That's great. I love being used as bait.
No idea what the monster might be?
Why?
What's so bad about San Francisco?
What's the Mountain of Despair?
You really don't know? Ask stupid Zoe. She's the expert.
That's why you don't get along with Zoe.
What?
The Hunters tried to recruit you,
 she admitted. 
But?
I would've had to leave Luke.
Oh.
That's harsh,
Hard to admit Zoe was right.
She wasn't right! Luke never let me down. Never.
We'll have to fight him,
There's no way around it.
You haven't seen him lately,
I know it's hard to believe, but—
I'll do what I have to.
Even if that means killing him?
Do me a favor,
Get out of my car.
Percy.
Annabeth wanted to join the Hunters, too. Maybe you should think about why.
Oh, don't be afraid of dreams,
If it weren't for dreams,
I'm incognito. Call me Fred.
A god named Fred?
Can you help us, then?
Shhh. I already have. Haven't you been looking outside?
The train. How fast are we moving?
But where is Artemis?
And Annabeth?
Oh, you mean that girl you lost? Hmm. I don't know.
What about the monster Artemis was seeking?
Do you know what it is?
No,
But it's your Oracle,
Can't you tell us what the prophecy means?
In other words, you don't know.
Hurry!
He will find us!
I'm not afraid,
You should be!
There is no need to run,
Not this one,
I don't trust your father,
You should not,
Then why don't you help me, pretty one?
Then there's nothing for it.
Wait.'
Take it,
And make of it a weapon.
A hairpin? How will this slay Ladon, pretty one?
It may not,
But it is all I can offer, if you insist on being stubborn.
Well balanced,
Anaklusmos,
Too late! He is here!
Percy,
It's morning. The train's stopped. Come on!
That's good, I guess. But we've got to get there first.
Great,
There's a coffee shop!
Yes,
Coffee is good.
And pastries,
And wax paper.
You could call for a taxi from Alamogordo,
Wonderful,
But the clerk said—
I know,
I'm checking anyway.
Nice rat,
So… how do you like being a Hunter so far?
You're not still mad at me for joining, are you?
Nah. Long as, you know… you're happy.
Nico didn't understand my decision,
He'll be all right,
Lot of good it did her.
Okay. Except for that, you're a good guy.
So what's the story with you and Nico?
I think it was a boarding school in D.C. It seems like so long ago.
You never lived with your parents? I mean, your mortal parent?
Why?
So you've been raising Nico pretty much all your life?
Just the two of you?
Zoe seems to trust you,
When?
 I said, before I could stop myself. 
How did you… The invisibility hat. Were you eavesdropping?
No! I mean, not really. I just—
We should do the tracking spell,
Grover, do you have any acorns left?
Umm,
Grover, thy cup.
Hey!
I just… What's wrong with Grover?
I don't know,
He collapsed.
Uuuuuhhhh,
Well, get him up!
We have to get out of here.
Back up,
It's near,
It's here,
No,
The gift. The gift from the Wild.
We'll have to go one-on-one,
Agreed,
The Wild!
Percy!
How did you do that?
I don't know,
Lucky stab?
Well, do it again!
Plan?
A gift,
REEEEEEEEET!
Don't kill it.'
That's the Erymanthian Boar,
It's a gift,
A blessing from the Wild!
REEEEEEET!
Yeah, I feel blessed!
Scatter!
It wants to kill us!
Of course,
It's wild!
So how is that a blessing?
Keep moving!
This way.'
Follow me!
No!
Come on!
It'll hold our weight, probably.
I can't!
Now!
You're afraid of heights.
Don't be stupid.
No, no,
Helloooooo?
Down here!
A blessing of the Wild,
I agree,
We must use it.
Hold up,
Explain to me why you're so sure this pig is a blessing.
Fun,
Like… pig cowboys.
What's gone?
Automatic steering,
Great.
Wait a second,
Of course,
What presence?
This is as far as he'll go,
We need to get off while he's eating.
It likes the mountains better,
I can't blame it,
Look.
Whoa,
Something tells me we're not going to find a car rental here,
I don't suppose you got another wild boar up your sleeve?
That's us,
Those five nuts right there.
Which one is me?
The little deformed one,
Oh, shut up.
That cluster right there,
that's trouble.
A monster?
The stars are out,
Amazing,
I've never actually seen the Milky Way.
This is nothing,
You talk like you're not human,
For you,
Not thee
But you use you for the beginning of a sentence.
And for the end,
No thou. No thee. Just you
I hate this language. It changes too often!
If only Pan were here, he would set things right.
Maybe it was the coffee,
He sent us help,
What I want to know,
I don't know. I just stabbed it and it went up in flames.
Maybe there's something special about your knife,
It is the same as mine,
Maybe you have to hit the skeleton in a certain spot,
Never mind,
No!
Not there!
Why?
Bianca,
How could you know that?
Oh, great,
Wait,
What is the Lotus Casino?
A couple of years ago,
No,
No, that's not possible.
You said somebody came and got you out,
Yes.
What did he look like? What did he say?
I… I don't remember. Please, I really don't want to talk about this.
Yes, but—
Bianca,
Don't be silly,
And who was the president before that?
Roosevelt.
Theodore or Franklin'?
Franklin,
F.D.R.
Like FDR Drive?
Bianca,
That's impossible,
I… I'm not that old.
It's okay, Bianca, The important thing is you and Nico are safe. You made it out.
But how?
I told you.
But who? Why did he do it?
Not so fast now, are you, punk?
Ares,
At ease, people.
This is a friendly meeting.
What lady?
Well, well. I heard you were back.
Thalia, daughter of Zeus,
What's your business, Ares?
Who's in the car?
 He jutted his chin toward Zoe and Bianca. 
We will not leave him alone with thee, Lord Ares,
Besides,
the taco place is closed.
Go on,
I'll handle this.
You heard the boy,
He's big and strong. He's got things under control.
Get inside, punk,
Ah, there you are, Percy,
I am Aphrodite.
Um uh gah.
Aren't you sweet. Hold this, please.
Do you know why you're here?
I… I don't know,
Oh, dear,
Still in denial?
I don't know what you're talking about,
Well then, why are you on this quest?
Artemis has been captured!
But she was chasing a monster,
Annabeth is in trouble.
Exactly!
I have to help her,
I've been having these dreams.
Ah, you even dream about her! That's so cute!
No! I mean… that's not what I meant.
Percy, I'm on your side. I'm the reason you're here, after all.
What?
The poisoned T-shirt the Stoll brothers gave Phoebe,
You did that?
Wait a second, I never said—
I wasn't sure—
Uh…
Oh, put the mirror down,
I look fine.
Now listen, Percy,
Do you know where she is?
Love conquers all,
Didn't they start the Trojan War and get thousands of people killed?
Pfft. That's not the point. Follow your heart.
But… I don't know where it's going. My heart, I mean.
Not knowing is half the fun,
No, no,
Don't do that.
And don't worry,
That's really okay,
Don't go to any trouble.
You're so cute. I wish all my daughters could break the heart of a boy as nice as you.
What?
You mean Hephaestus?
You're lucky, punk.
Be grateful.
For what?
That we're being so nice. If it was up to me—
So why haven't you killed me?
I'd love to kill you, seriously,
Why wait? I beat you once. How's that ankle healing up?
What did she want with you?
Oh, uh, not sure,
For once I agree with Zoe,
You can't trust Aphrodite.
So,
how do we get out of here?
That way,
That is west.
How can you tell?
Ursa Major is in the north,
which means that must be west.
Oh, yeah,
The bear thing.
Show some respect. It was a fine bear. A worthy opponent.
You act like it was real.
Guys,
Look!
Whoa,
That stuff… some of it looks like real gold.
It is,
Junk?
You call this junk?
It's delicious!
I'm serious!
Look!
A Hunter's bow!
It's just like Percys sword!
Leave it, Bianca.
But—
I don't like this place,
You think we're going to get attacked by killer refrigerators?
That's the second time you've agreed with Zoe,
What is that?
They look like—
Toes,
Really, really large toes.
Let's go around,
Far around.
But the road is right over there,
Quicker to climb over.
Why did you do that?
I don't know. I, uh, don't like fake feet?
Come on.
Around.
We made it out,
Thank the gods.
Talos!
Who—who's Talos?
One of Hephaestus's creations,
Someone took something,
Who took something?
I'm a lot of things, but I'm not a thief.
Run!
You took something,
That bow.
No!
Give it back!
Throw it down!
I… I didn't take the bow! Besides, it's too late.
What did. you take?
Move!
Hey, Talos!
Come on!
How can you think of Mythomagic at a time like this?
Throw it down,
Maybe the giant will leave us alone.
No!
Crazy-idea time,
Anything.
How? You'll have to stand under its foot! You'll be crushed
Distract it,
I'll just have to time it right.
No. I'll go.
You can't. You're new at this! You'll die.
It's my fault the monster came after us,
It's my responsibility. Here.
Bianca, no!
What are you doing?
Get it to raise its foot!
Hey, Junk Boy!
Down here.
Grover!
Go, Bianca!
She is inside?
How will Bianca get out?
Look out!
Wait!
We can keep searching,
It's light now. We'll find her.
No we won't,
It happened just as it was supposed to.
What are you talking about?
The skeletons are still out there,
We need to keep moving.
It should've been me,
I should've gone into the giant.
Don't say that!
 He sniffled. 
Ah, Grover…
I'm… I'm okay.
There's a path,
We could get to the river.
That's a goat path,
So?
The rest of us aren't goats.
We can make it,
I think.
No,
I, uh, think we should go farther upstream.
But—
Come on,
A walk won't hurt us.
We need to go upstream,
Leave that to me,
Thanks for back there.
Don't mention it.
Can you really…
You know.
I think so. Usually I'm good with water.
Would you take Zoe?
I think, ah, maybe you can talk to her.
She's not going to like that.
I owe you one.
Two.
One and a half,
I hate naiads,
She-devils!
Whoa,
They're just playing.
Cursed water spirits. They've never forgiven me.
Forgiven you for what?
It was a long time ago. Never mind.
What happened to Bianca wasn't your fault,
It was my fault. I let her go.
But you're the lieutenant.
Look, you can't blame yourself for that.
If I had insisted on going with her—
You made this,
Who told thee?
I had a dream about it.
Who was the hero?
Do not make me say his name. I swore never to speak it again.
You act like I should know him.
I am sure you do, hero. Don't all you boys want to be just like him?
Your mother was a water goddess?
Yes, Pleione. She had five daughters. My sisters and I. The Hesperides.
Yes,
Ladon.
But weren't there only four sisters'?
There are now. I was exiled. Forgotten. Blotted out as if I never existed.
Why?
But—
Hoover Dam,
It's huge.
Seven hundred feet tall,
Built in the 1930s.
Five million cubic acres of water,
Largest construction project in the United States.
How do you know all that?
Annabeth,
She liked architecture.
She was nuts about monuments,
Spouted facts all the time.
So annoying.
I wish she were here,
We should go up there,
For her sake. Just to say we've been.
You are mad,
But that's where the road is.
And so, sightseeing it is.
How close are they?
There's a snack bar in the visitor center,
You've been here before?
Once. To see the guardians.
They were dedicated to Zeus when the dam was built,
What are they doing?
Rubbing the toes,
They think it's good luck.
Why?
When you were here last, did they talk to you or anything?
Let us find the dam snack bar,
We should eat while we can.
The dam snack bar?
Yes. What is funny?
Nothing,
And I need to use the dam restroom.
I want to use the dam water fountain,
And…
I want to buy a dam T-shirt.
Moooo.
Did I just hear a cow?
A dam cow?
No,
I'm serious.
I hear nothing.
Percy, are you okay?
Yeah,
You guys go ahead. I'll be right in.
What's wrong?
Nothing,
I… I just need a minute. To think.
Moo.
What are you doing here?
Moo!
How did you get here?
Moo!
I can't,
My friends are inside.
Mooo!,
Hey!
Ah!
Hey, kid!
Stop!
We'll be going down seven hundred feet,
Does this go to the snack bar?
To the turbines, young man,
Oh, uh, sure. Is there another way out of the dam?
It's a dead end,
Go right ahead, folks,
And young man,
Oh my god.'
Do you always kill people when they blow their nose?
You're mortal!
I didn't—Wait, you can see it's a sword?
Well, it's either a sword or the biggest toothpick in the world,
You don't see a sword,
It's just a ballpoint pen.
Um… no. It's a sword, weirdo.
Who are you?
No!
I mean, I'm kind of in a hurry. I'm in trouble.
In a hurry or in trouble?
Um, sort of both.
Bathroom!
What?
Bathroom! Behind me! Now!
All clear. But you'd better hurry.
I owe you one, Rachel Elizabeth Dare.
What are those things?
They looked like—
Skeletons?
Do yourself a favor,
Forget it. Forget you ever saw me.
Forget you tried to kill me?
Yeah. That, too.
But who are you?
Percy—
Gotta go!
What kind of name is Percy Gotta-go?
 I gasped. 
 But we just got our burritos!
He's right! Look.
Elevator!
Burrito fight!
What now?
Four against eleven,
And they cannot die.
It's been nice adventuring with you guys,
Whoa,
Their toes really are bright.
Percy!
This isn't the time.
Thalia,
Pray to your dad.
He never answers.
Just this once,
Do it!
No!
He won't answer me.
This time is different!
Who says?
Athena, I think.
Try it,
Man, it feels good to stand up!
Will ya look at my toes?
Trouble!
Get us out of here!
Zeus's kid?
Could I get a please, Miss Zeus's Kid?
Please!
Could use a stretch,
Tell me when it's over,
Everything's fine,
Are… are we very high?
Nah,
Not that high.
We are in the Sierras.'
Hey, hey, Frisco!
Oh, man,
I am so there!
You guys have visited San Francisco?
We automatons gotta have some fun once in a while, right?
Hank!
They're kids, man.
Oh, right.
Back to flying.
You did good back there,
Zeus listened.
Maybe,
Some mortals are like that,
Nobody knows why.
Well, the girl was annoying,
Must be nice to be a regular mortal.
Where you guys want to land?
Whoa.
There,
By the Embarcadero Building.
Good thinking,
Me and Hank can blend in with the pigeons.
Kidding,
Sheesh, can't statues have a sense of humor?
show the trail,
But how?
Nereus,
What?
Isn't that what Apollo told you to do? Find Nereus?
 I remembered. 
Old Nereus, eh?
You know him?
What do you mean?
Come,
I will show thee.
Oh, yeah,
A typical male vagrant.
Thanks a lot,
Why am I doing this again?
I told thee. To blend in.
He will be down there somewhere,
How do I know which one is him?
Sneak up,
Act homeless. You will know him. He will smell… different.
Great.
And once I find him?
Grab him,
We've got your back,
Beat it, kid!
Ahhhhhl
Help me!
That's a crime!
I don't have any money!
I don't want money,
I'm a half-blood! I want information.'
Heroes! Why do you always pick on me?
Because you know everything!
Oh, no!
Not the water!
Whoa!
I'm Poseidon's son,
Curse that upstart! I was here first!
You got him!
You don't have to sound so amazed,
I've got more than one question,
Only one question per capture! That's the rule.
Oh, that's too easy,
He's right there.
Where?
The deal is complete!
You tricked me!
Wait.
What is that?
MOOOOOOOO!
Ah, Bessie,
Not now.
Mooo!
He says his name isn't Bessie.
You can understand her… er, him?
The Ophi-what?
It means serpent bull in Greek,
But what's it doing here?
Moooooooo!
He says Percy is his protector,
And he's running from the bad people. He says they are close.
Wait,
You know this cow?
And you just forgot to mention this before?
Well… yeah.
I am a fool,
I know this story!
What story?
From the War of the Titans,
Bessie?
That is how we were wrong,
MMMM,
I don't think he likes the S-word,
How could anyone hurt him?
He's harmless.
MMMMMM!
Um,
Maybe we could avoid talking about entrails, too.
No one knows,
We have to protect him,
If Luke gets hold of him—
Luke wouldn't hesitate,
Yes, it is, my dear,
This is just pairrr-fect,
Long ago, the gods banished me to Persia,
Where… where are the skeletons?
We beat you once before,
Wait!
Zoe, don't!
What are you talking about?
Surely it is clear,
You know it is the right choice,
Thalia,
snap out of it!
I… I don't—
Your father helped you,
Stop him!
Grover,
tell Bessie to dive deep and stay down!
Moooooo!
The cow…
Come on!
Get them!
Go over the side!
I won't leave you guys,
We fight together.
You have to get word to camp!
Get word to camp,
Good idea.
Camp Half-Blood!
Do you mind?
Where's Chiron!
How rude.
Is that how you say hello?
Hello,
We're about to die! Where's Chiron?
About to die,
We're dead.
How noble,
So what is the problem, exactly?
Mmm.
So that's it. I see.
You don't even care!
You'd just as soon watch us die!
Let's see. I think I'm in the mood for pizza tonight.
There!
Excellent,
You could ask for help,
You could say please.
Please, Mr. D,
Help.
No!
I will deal with you myself!
Well,
That was fun.
How could you… How did you—
Such gratitude,
Mr. D,
The Ophiotaurus,
Can you get it to camp?
I do not transport livestock. That's your problem.
But where do we go?
Mr. D,
You called me by my right name,
You called me Percy Jackson.
I most certainly did not, Peter Johnson. Now off with you!
What did he mean… 'You know where to go'?
The garden of my sisters,
I must go home.
We will never make it,
Mooo,
I don't get it,
Why do we have to get there at sunset?
The Hesperides are the nymphs of the sunset,
What happens if we miss it?
We need a car,
But what about Bessie?
Well, yeah,
So maybe we could coax him back to Long Island Sound,
But he was following me
If I'm not there, would he know where he's going?
Moo,
I… I can show him,
I'll go with him.
I'm the only one who can talk to him,
It makes sense.
The blessing of the Wild,
Dad,
A prayer like that needs a sacrifice,
Something big.
Percy,
If I'm going to survive,
Well, no time to lose.
Be careful,
We will,
Moooo?
Yes,
Mooo!
Well, that is one problem addressed,
Thalia's right,
Wait,
Who?
Hello,
Are you delivering my airplanes?
Um, no, sir,
Drat,
I need three more Sopwith Camels.
Right,
Annabeth?
You'd better come in,
Dad!
He's taking apart my robots!
Bobby,
don't take apart your brother's robots.
I'm Bobby,
He's Matthew!
Matthew,
don't take apart your brother's robots!
Okay, Dad!
We'll go upstairs to my study. This way.
Honey?
Who are our guests?
Oh,
This is…
Frederick,
You forgot to ask them their names?
Dear,
They came about Annabeth.
 She smiled at me. 
Whoa!
Oh, right,
How do you know that?
I was there,
You—
She's a Hunter, sir,
But that's not why we're here. We need—
You saw the Sopwith Camels?
Sir,
Annabeth is in danger.
Of course,
Tell me everything.
My poor brave Annabeth. We must hurry.
Sir, we need transportation to Mount Tamalpais,
I'll drive you. Hmm. it would be faster to fly in my Camel, but it only seats two.
Whoa, you have an actual biplane?
Down at Crissy Field,
Sir,
Snacks,
What's this about?
Annabeth is in danger,
Right!
My keys…
Right!
Thank you both. We should go. Now
Percy,
I'll tell her,
Can't this thing go any faster?
You both sound like my mother,
Shut up!
Why does everything smell like cough drops?
Eucalyptus.
The stuff koala bears eat?
And monsters,
They love chewing the leaves. Especially dragons.
Dragons chew eucalyptus leaves?
Believe me,
if you had dragon breath, you would chew eucalyptus too.
So that's the Mountain of Despair?
Yes,
Why do they call it that?
The General,
We have to concentrate,
The Mist is really strong here.
The magical kind or the natural kind?
Both.
Look!
What?
A big white ship,
Docked near the beach. It looked like a cruise ship.
Luke's ship?
We will have company, then,
Kronos's army.
Stop the car. NOW!
Out!
One shall perish by a parent's hand
Whose, then?
I don't know. Zoe said Kronos's name. Maybe he—
No. That wasn't it.
Wait,
Where's Zoe? Zoe!
Zoe!
You mean we're here?
Very close,
Follow me.
Concentrate on Zoe,
I don't want to talk about it.
You wouldn't actually have… you know?
I was just shocked. That's all.
The apples of immortality,
Hera's wedding gift from Zeus.
Sisters,
We do not see any sister,
You've got it wrong.
Nobody is going to die.
Perseus Jackson,
Yes,
I do not see why he is a threat.
Who said I was a threat?
Tempting sometimes,
But no, thanks. He's my friend.
There are no friends here, daughter of Zeus,
Only enemies. Go back.
Not without Annabeth,
And Artemis,
We must approach the mountain.
You know he will kill thee,
You are no match for him.
Artemis must be freed,
Let us pass.
He will not hurt me,
No? And what about thy so-called friends?
Ladon! Wake!
Are you mad?
You never had any courage, sister,
That is thy problem.
Zoe, don't,
You're not a Hesperid anymore. He'll kill you.
Ladon is trained to protect the tree,
Should,
Not exactly reassuring.
It is the only way,
Even the three of us together cannot fight him.
It's me, my little dragon,
Zoe has come back.
Fool.
I used to feed thee by hand,
Do you still like lamb's meat?
No!
Run!
The ruins of Mount Othrys,
Yes,
It was not here before. This is bad.
What's Mount Othrys?
The mountain fortress of the Titans,
You're hurt,
Let me see.
No! It is nothing. I was saying… in the first war, Othrys was blasted to pieces.
But… how is it here?
Why?
This is Atlas's mountain,
Where he holds—
Where he used to hold up the sky.
My lady!
Ah, how touching.
Luke,
Let her go.
That is the General's decision, Thalia. But it's good to see you again.
Do not respond,
Do not challenge him.
Wait a second,
You're Atlas?
You're not going to hurt Zoe
I won't let you.
 I frowned. 
Yes,
Atlas is my father.
Let Artemis go,
No! Do not offer, Zoe! I forbid you.
Hoo-hoo,
From holding the sky,
I don't understand,
Why can't Artemis just let go of the sky?
 Atlas smiled. 
Fight us,
And let's see.
So you're another coward,
As for you, daughter of Zeus, it seems Luke was wrong about you.
I wasn't wrong,
Thalia, you still can join us. Call the Ophiotaurus. It will come to you. Look!
Thalia, call the Ophiotaurus,
Luke…
What happened to you?
Free Annabeth. Let her go.
If you join me,
Do not, Thalia,
We must fight them.
Thalia,
No.
We will raise Mount Othrys right here,
This is only a taste of what is to come,
Yes, you do, Thalia,
Now,
Go on, then!
Percy!
Beware!
Fool!
Run, boy,
You must run!
Die, little hero,
No!
ARGH!
The sky,
Give it to me.
No, boy,
You don't know what you're asking. It will crush you!
Annabeth took it!
She barely survived. She had the spirit of a true huntress. You will not last so long.
I'll die anyway,
Give me the weight of the sky!
Yield!
You never could beat me, Luke.
Well see, my old friend.
You fight well for a girl.
But you are no match for me.
No!
The first blood in a new war,
Noooooo!
Not again!
Well?
Don't kill him!
He's a traitor,
A traitor!
We'll bring Luke back,
To Olympus. He… he'll be useful.
Is that what you want, Thalia?
No!
Luke!
Kill them!
Artemis!
The wound is poisoned,
Atlas poisoned her?
No,
Not Atlas.
The stars,
I cannot see them.
Nectar and ambrosia,
Come on! We have to get her some.
Get away from my daughter!
Dad?
Run!
A brave man,
Hang in there!
It'll be all right!
That's… my dad!
Get in,
Like Santa Claus's sleigh,
Well, not bad for a middle-aged mortal, I suppose.
But the celestial bronze bullets! How did you get those?
I decided to try melting some down to make bullet casings,
Dad…
Annabeth, Percy,
Can't you heal her with magic?
I mean… you're a goddess.
Have I… served thee well?
With great honor,
The finest of my attendants.
Rest. At last.
I can try to heal the poison, my brave one.
I am sorry we argued,
We could have been sisters.
It's my fault,
Perhaps not all men,
Zoe—
Stars,
I can see the stars again, my lady.
Yes, my brave one. They are beautiful tonight.
Stars,
Let the world honor you, my Huntress,
Live forever in the stars.
I must go to Olympus immediately,
You did well,
For a man.
Well,
She was impressive; though I must say I still prefer Athena.
Dad, I… I'm sorry that—
Shh.
Do what you must, my dear. I know this isn't easy for you.
Blackjack!
It was rough,
Nah,
These are my friends. We need to get to Olympus pretty fast.
Fascinating,
Why, if the British had had these pegasi in the cavalry charges on the Crimea,
the charge of the light brigade—
Dad!
Your dad seems cool,
I guess so,
We've been arguing for so many years.
Yeah, you said.
You think I was lying about that?
They're still in San Francisco, Percy. I can't live so far from camp.
So what are you going to do now?
I don't know,
But thank you for rescuing me.
Hey, no big deal. We're friends.
You didn't believe I was dead?
Never.
Neither is Luke, you know. I mean… he isn't dead.
He isn't dead,
I know it. The same way you knew about me.
You're the man, Blackjack,
Er, the horse, I mean.
You don't believe me about Luke,
There it is.
It's started.
What's started?
The winter solstice,
The Council of the Gods.
Yeah.
Welcome, heroes,
Mooo!
You made it!
Go on,
Do what?
Heroes,
The Council has been informed of your deeds,
At my Lord Zeus's command,
I gotta say
these kids did okay.
Heroes win laurels—
Um, yes, first class,
All in favor of not disintegrating them?
Wait just a minute,
Ares,
Nor my daughter,
She has done well.
Mother!
How can you—
Right!
Hey, wait a minute. Who you callin'—
Oh, please, Ares,
Save the fighting for later.
I do not pass judgment,
I will not have them punished,
Calm down, sis,
Jeez, you need to lighten up.
Don't call me sis! I will reward them.
Well,
Bessie? You want to destroy Bessie?
Mooooooo!
You have named the Ophiotaurus Bessie?
Dad,
You can't,
You have to trust them,
Sir, you have to trust them.
Trust a hero?
Annabeth is right,
Annabeth,
Don't.
What?
Look, I need to tell you something,
I couldn't stand it if… I don't want you to—
Percy?
You look like you're going to be sick.
I shall have a new lieutenant,
If she will accept it.
No,
Thalia,
Daughter of Zeus. Will you join the Hunt?
I will,
My daughter, consider well—
Father,
I'm honoring a friend,
Great,
I'm proud to be your friend.
Now for the Ophiotaurus,
This boy is still dangerous,
No.
And why should we trust you?
I'm only fourteen,
If this prophecy is about me, that's two more years.
Two years for Kronos to deceive you,
Mother!
It is only the truth, child. It is bad strategy to keep the animal alive. Or the boy.
You won't take it under the sea!
Brother, please,
Fine,
All in favor?
We have a majority,
Pan! Pan!
Thanks,
But seriously, I'm no good at archery.
Ah, nonsense,
You won't let me down, I hope.
Dad… hi.
Hello, Percy. You've done well.
I won't let you down,
Your friend Luke—
He's not my friend,
Sorry.
Your former friend Luke,
Luke fell pretty hard,
He's dead.
No, Percy. He is not.
What?
How can he be alive?
That fall should've killed him!
What about Atlas?
Luke did it,
Yes,
Luke is… an interesting case.
I'd better take care of that,
Athena.
You never take risks?
That's not a flaw. Just because I want to help my friends—
The most dangerous flaws are those which are good in moderation,
I hope the Council's decisions prove wise,
Percy!
Oh… Mom.
I will leave you,
For now.
Was she giving you a hard time?
No,
It's… fine.
So,
What did you want to tell me earlier?
All right, Seaweed Brain.
Yay!
That means it was good! It saved your life!
It sure did, big guy,
But now it's ruined.
Not ruined!
I will visit and fix it next summer.
Seriously?
They'll let you take time off?
Yes! I have made two thousand seven hundred and forty-one magic swords,
Sally Jackson,
Upper East Side, Manhattan.
Sure, Sally. No problem.
I'm, uh, fine. How's that writing seminar going?
It's fine. But that's not important. Tell me what's happened!
I knew you could do it!
I'm so proud.
Yeah, well, I'd better let you get back to your homework.
Percy, I… Paul and I—
Mom, are you happy?
Then it's cool. Seriously. Don't worry about me.
You promise not to call him Mr. Blowfish?
Well, maybe not to his face, anyway.
Sally?
I'd better go,
See you for Christmas?
Are you putting blue candy in my stocking?
If you're not too old for that.
I'm never too old for candy.
I'll see you then.
I got news,
Bad news.
I'll fill you in later,
Luke is alive,
Annabeth was right.
How do you know?
Well.
figure something out,
Two years may seem like a long time,
How do you know?
Why would he care about camp?
Because the gods use heroes as their tools,
Hey! Where's… where's my sister?
Hey, Nico.
She wanted you to have this.
You promised you would protect her,
Nico,
You promised!
I shouldn't have trusted you.
Wait. What nightmares?
I hate you!
She might be alive,
I don't know for sure—
She's dead.
What do you mean, you can feel it?
You're trying to kill me!
You brought these… these things?
No! I mean, yes, they followed me, but no! Nico, run. They can't be destroyed.
I don't trust you!
Run, Nico!
Get help!
No!
No!
Go away!
How did you—
Go away!
I hate you! I wish you were dead!
We have to tell Chiron,
No,
Um,
A son of Hades,
I don't think so,
I don't think Hades broke the oath.
What?
He's their dad,
The Lotus Casino!
But how did they get out?
I don't know,
It might start them fighting among each other again,
But you can't hide things from the gods. Not forever.
I don't need forever,
Just two years. Until I'm sixteen.
No,
I choose the prophecy. It will be about me.
Why are you saying that?
I can't let Nico be in any more danger,
The poor kid who hates you and wants to see you dead,
Maybe we can find him,
If Luke gets hold of him—
Luke won't,
I'll make sure he's got other things to worry about. Namely, me.
So young,
You really think the first attack will be here?
It will not be until summer, at least,
What about you?
You'll send an Iris-message if anything goes wrong?
All right,
Deal. And, Percy—
He spoke.'
Calm down, my young satyr,
What is the matter?
I… I was playing music in the parlor,
Who?
Pan!
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
What did he say?
Just three words. He said, 'I await you...'
