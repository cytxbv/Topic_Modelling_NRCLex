I’m going to kill her,
It’s okay. I like peanut butter.
That’s it.
You’re already on probation,
You’re absolutely right.
Will you shut up?
Mr. Jackson,
did you have a comment?
No, sir.
That’s Kronos eating his kids, right?
Yes,
Well…
God?
Titan,
Eeew!
—and so there was this big fight between the gods and the Titans,
and the gods won.
And why, Mr. Jackson,
Busted,
Shut up,
I don’t know, sir.
I see.
Sir?
You must learn the answer to my question,
About the Titans?
About real life. And how your studies apply to it.
Oh.
What you learn from me,
What ho!
Detention?
Nah,
Can I have your apple?
Oops.
Count to ten, get control of your temper.
Percy pushed me!
Did you see—
—the water—
—like it grabbed her—
Now, honey—
I know,
A month erasing workbooks.
Come with me,
Wait!
It was me. I pushed her.
I don’t think so, Mr. Underwood,
But—
You—will—stay—here.
It’s okay, man,
Thanks for trying.
Honey,
Now.
You’ve been giving us problems, honey,
Yes, ma’am.
I’ll—I’ll try harder, ma’am.
We are not fools, Percy Jackson,
Well?
Ma’am, I don’t…
Your time is up,
What ho, Percy!
Die, honey!
Who?
Our teacher. Duh!
Who?
Not funny, man,
This is serious.
Sir,
where’s Mrs. Dodds?
Who?
The other chaperone. Mrs. Dodds. The pre-algebra teacher.
…worried about Percy, sir.
…alone this summer,
We would only make matters worse by rushing him,
We need the boy to mature more.
But he may not have time. The summer solstice deadline—
Sir, he saw her.…
His imagination,
Sir, I…I can’t fail in my duties again.
You know what that would mean.
You haven’t failed, Grover,
Nothing,
My nerves haven’t been right since the winter solstice.
Mine neither,
But I could have sworn…
Go back to the dorm,
Don’t remind me.
Hey,
You going to be ready for this test?
You look awful.
Is everything okay?
Just…tired.
Percy,
Okay, sir.
I mean…
Right,
No, no,
Thanks,
Thanks a lot, sir, for reminding me.
Percy—
Oh,
That’s cool.
Looking for Kindly Ones?
Wha—what do you mean?
How much did you hear?
Oh…not much. What’s the summer solstice deadline?
Grover—
Grover, you’re a really, really bad liar.
What’s Half—
Don’t say it aloud!
That’s my, um…summer address.
Okay,
So, like, if I want to come visit your mansion.
Or…or if you need me.
Why would I need you?
Grover,
what exactly are you protecting me from?
Grover?
Hey, man—
Tell me they’re not looking at you. They are, aren’t they?
Yeah. Weird, huh? You think those socks would fit me?
Not funny, Percy. Not funny at all.
We’re getting on the bus,
Come on.
What?
It’s a thousand degrees in there.
Come on!
Darn right!
Everybody back on board!
Grover?
Yeah?
What are you not telling me?
The middle one took out her scissors, and she cut the yarn.
You saw her snip the cord.
Yeah. So?
This is not happening,
I don’t want this to be like the last time.
What last time?
Always sixth grade. They never get past sixth.
Grover,
Let me walk you home from the bus station. Promise me.
Is this like a superstition or something?
Why does this always happen?
Why does it always have to be sixth grade?
East One-hundred-and-fourth and First,
So, you’re home.
Where’s my mom?
Working,
You got any cash?
guy secret.
I don’t have any cash,
You took a taxi from the bus station,
Come on, Gabe,
The kid just got here.
Am I right?
Fine,
I hope you lose.
Your report card came, brain boy!
study.
Percy?
Oh, Percy.
What?
Did something scare you?
No, Mom.
I have a surprise for you,
We’re going to the beach.
Montauk?
Three nights—same cabin.
When?
As soon as I get changed.
I was on my way, honey,
I knew it,
He won’t let us go.
Of course he will,
Yes, honey,
And you won’t take my car anywhere but there and back.
We’ll be very careful.
Maybe if you hurry with that sevenlayer dip…And maybe if the kid apologizes for interrupting my poker game.
I’m sorry,
Yeah, whatever,
Thank you, Percy,
Not a scratch on this car, brain boy,
Not one little scratch.
He was kind, Percy,
How old was I?
I mean…when he left?
But…he knew me as a baby.
Are you going to send me away again?
I don’t know, honey.
Because you don’t want me around?
Because I’m not normal,
Safe from what?
I’ve tried to keep you as close to me as I could,
My father wanted me to go to a special school?
Not a school,
A summer camp.
I’m sorry, Percy,
For good? But if it’s only a summer camp…
Hurricane.
Searching all night,
What were you thinking?
Percy,
O Zeu kai alloi theoi!
Percy. Tell me now!
So, you and my mom…know each other?
Not exactly,
Watching me?
I am your friend.
Um…what are you, exactly?
That doesn’t matter right now.
It doesn’t matter? From the waist down, my best friend is a donkey—
Blaa-ha-ha!
Goat!
What?
I’m a goat from the waist down.
You just said it didn’t matter.
Whoa. Wait. Satyrs. You mean like…Mr. Brunner’s myths?
So you admit there was a Mrs. Dodds!
Of course.
Then why—
The less you knew, the fewer monsters you’d attract,
Who I—wait a minute, what do you mean?
Percy,
Safety from what? Who’s after me?
Oh, nobody much,
Grover!
Sorry, Mrs. Jackson. Could you drive faster, please?
Where are we going?
The summer camp I told you about.
The place you didn’t want me to go.
Please, dear,
Because some old ladies cut yarn.
Those weren’t old ladies,
Whoa. You said ‘you.’
No I didn’t. I said ‘someone.’
You meant ‘you.’ As in me.
I meant you, like ‘someone.’ Not you, you.
Boys!
What was that?
We’re almost there,
Ow.
Percy!
I’m okay.…
Grover!
Food,
Percy,
we have to…
Who is—
Percy,
Get out of the car.
Climb out the passenger’s side!
What?
That’s the property line,
Mom, you’re coming too.
No!
You are coming with me. Help me carry Grover.
Food!
He doesn’t want us,
But…
We don’t have time, Percy. Go. Please.
I told you—
Mom! I am not leaving you. Help me with Grover.
That’s—
Pasiphae’s son,
But he’s the Min—
Don’t say his name,
Names have power.
Food?
Shhh,
Mom, what’s he doing? Doesn’t he see us?
His sight and hearing are terrible,
Percy,
How do you know all this?
Keeping me near you? But—
Run, Percy!
I can’t go any farther. Run!
Mom!
Go!
No!
Hey!
Hey, stupid! Ground beef!
Raaaarrrrr!
Food!
He’s the one. He must be.
Silence, Annabeth,
What?
I’m sorry,
I don’t…
Careful,
You saved my life,
The Minotaur,
Um, Percy, it isn’t a good idea—
That’s what they call him in the Greek myths, isn’t it?
The Minotaur. Half man, half bull.
My mom. Is she really…
I’m sorry,
Oh, Styx!
It wasn’t your fault.
Yes, it was. I was supposed to protect you.
Did my mother ask you to protect me?
No. But that’s my job. I’m a keeper. At least…I was.
But why…
Don’t strain yourself,
Here.
Was it good?
What did it taste like?
Sorry,
I should’ve let you taste.
No! That’s not what I meant. I just…wondered.
Chocolate-chip cookies,
My mom’s. Homemade.
And how do you feel?
Like I could throw Nancy Bobofit a hundred yards.
That’s good,
What do you mean?
Come on. Chiron and Mr. D are waiting.
That’s Mr. D,
Mr. Brunner!
Ah, good, Percy,
Now we have four for pinochle.
Uh, thanks.
Annabeth?
Sure, Chiron.
You drool when you sleep.
So,
Not Mr. Brunner,
Okay.
Oh. Right. Sorry.
I must say, Percy,
House call?
You came to Yancy just to teach me?
Grover,
are you playing or not?
Yes, sir!
You do know how to play pinochle?
I’m afraid not,
I’m afraid not, sir,
Sir,
Well,
I’m sure the boy can learn,
Please,
I asked the same question.
Percy,
Did your mother tell you nothing?
She said…
Typical,
What?
I’m afraid there’s too much to tell,
Orientation film?
No,
Mr. D,
Eh? Oh, all right.
Wait,
You’re telling me there’s such a thing as God.
Well, now,
Metaphysical? But you were just talking about—
Smaller?
Yes, quite. The gods we discussed in Latin class.
Zeus,
Hera. Apollo. You mean them.
Young man,
But they’re stories,
Science!
And tell me, Perseus Jackson
Percy,
You mean, whether people believed in you or not,
Exactly,
Oh, you’d better,
P-please, sir. He’s just lost his mother. He’s in shock.
A lucky thing, too,
Mr. D,
your restrictions.
Dear me.
Old habits! Sorry!
A wood nymph,
Yes,
And…
your father is…
Di immortales, Chiron,
You’re Dionysus,
The god of wine.
Y-yes, Mr. D.
You’re a god.
Yes, child.
A god. You.
Would you like to test me, child?
No. No, sir.
I believe I win.
Not quite, Mr. D,
The game goes to me.
I’m tired,
Y-yes, sir.
Will Grover be okay?
Mount Olympus,
You mean the Greek gods are here? Like…in America?
Well, certainly. The gods move with the heart of the West.
The what?
And then they died.
Who are you, Chiron? Who…who am I?
Who are you?
What a relief,
That’s him.
What’s up there?
Just the attic.
Somebody lives there?
No,
Not a single living thing.
Come along, Percy,
Lots to see.
It pays our expenses,
Grover won’t get in too much trouble, will he?
But he did that!
I might agree with you,
He’ll get a second chance, won’t he?
How old is he?
Oh, twenty-eight.
What! And he’s in sixth grade?
That’s horrible.
Quite,
That’s not fair,
Let’s move along, shall we?
Chiron,
If the gods and Olympus and all that are real…
Yes, child?
Does that mean the Underworld is real, too?
Yes, child.
What do you mean, ‘until we know more’?
Come, Percy. Let’s see the woods.
Stocked with what?
Armed with what?
My own—?
No,
Sword and spear fights?
Cabin challenges and all that,
What do you do when it rains?
Zeus and Hera?
Correct,
Their cabins look empty.
Several of the cabins are. That’s true. No one ever stays in one or two.
No,
You said your name was Chiron. Are you really…
But, shouldn’t you be dead?
Doesn’t it ever get boring?
No, no,
Horribly depressing, at times, but never boring.
Why depressing?
Oh, look,
Annabeth is waiting for us.
Annabeth,
Yes, sir.
Cabin eleven,
Well, then,
Good luck, Percy. I’ll see you at dinner.
Well?
Go on.
Percy Jackson, meet cabin eleven.
Regular or undetermined?
Undetermined.
This is Luke,
He’s your counselor for now.
For now?
You’re undetermined,
How long will I be here?
Good question,
Until you’re determined.
How long will that take?
Come on,
I’ll show you the volleyball court.
I’ve already seen it.
Come on.
What?
What’s your problem?
Don’t talk like that!
To get killed?
To fight the Minotaur! What do you think we train for?
Yes.
Then there’s only one.
Yes.
Monsters don’t die, Percy. They can be killed. But they don’t die.
Oh, thanks. That clears it up.
How did you know about Mrs. Dodds?
You talk in your sleep.
Look, is there anything we can say without it thundering?
My mom is Sally Jackson,
He’s dead. I never knew him.
Your father’s not dead, Percy.
How can you say that? You know him?
No, of course not.
Then how can you say—
Because I know you. You wouldn’t be here if you weren’t one of us.
You don’t know anything about me.
No?
How—
Diagnosed with dyslexia. Probably ADHD, too.
You sound like…you went through the same thing?
Ambrosia and nectar.
Well! A newbie!
Clarisse,
Sure, Miss Princess,
Erre es korakas!
You don’t stand a chance.
We’ll pulverize you,
Who’s this little runt?
Percy Jackson,
meet Clarisse, Daughter of Ares.
Like…the war god?
You got a problem with that?
No,
It explains the bad smell.
We got an initiation ceremony for newbies, Prissy.
Percy.
Whatever. Come on, I’ll show you.
Clarisse—
Stay out of it, wise girl.
Like he’s ‘Big Three’ material,
How did you…
I don’t know.
You are dead, new boy. You are totally dead.
What?
What are you thinking?
I’m thinking,
I’ve got training to do,
Annabeth, I’m sorry about the toilets.
Whatever.
It wasn’t my fault.
You need to talk to the Oracle,
Who?
Not who. What. The Oracle. I’ll ask Chiron.
Don’t encourage them,
Naiads are terrible flirts.
Naiads,
You mean, mentally disturbed kids?
I mean not human. Not totally human, anyway. Half-human.
Half-human and half-what?
I think you know.
God,
Half-god.
That’s…crazy.
But those are just—
But if all the kids here are half-gods—
Demigods,
That’s the official term. Or half-bloods.
Then who’s your dad?
My dad is a professor at West Point,
He’s human.
Who’s your mom, then?
Cabin six.
Meaning?
Athena. Goddess of wisdom and battle.
And my dad?
Undetermined,
like I told you before. Nobody knows.
Except my mother. She knew.
Maybe not, Percy. Gods don’t always reveal their identities.
My dad would have. He loved her.
You mean sometimes it doesn’t?
So I’m stuck here,
That’s it? For the rest of my life?
It depends,
So monsters can’t get in here?
Why would anybody want to summon a monster?
Practice fights. Practical jokes.
Practical jokes?
So…you’re a year-rounder?
I’ve been here since I was seven,
Why did you come so young?
None of your business.
Oh.
Unless?
Back in the sick room,
when you were feeding me that stuff—
Ambrosia.
Yeah. You asked me something about the summer solstice.
So you do know something?
You’ve been to Olympus?
But…how did you get there?
Oh, sure.
Right after we visited,
I’ve got to get a quest,
Found you a sleeping bag,
Thanks.
No prob.
I don’t belong here,
I don’t even believe in gods.
Yeah,
So your dad is Hermes?
Yeah. Hermes.
The wing-footed messenger guy.
You ever meet your dad?
Once.
I hate prophecies.
What do you mean?
Somebody special?
Don’t worry about it, kid,
Eleven, fall in!
To the gods!
To the gods!
Speak to it. Whatever you want—nonalcoholic, of course.
Cherry Coke.
Blue Cherry Coke.
Here you go, Percy,
Come on,
You’re kidding.
Hermes.
Personally,
Er, Percy Jackson,
There’s more where that came from, punk,
Good luck,
Maybe he’ll go easy on me,
Lunge!
Now, back!
Okay, everybody circle up!
This is difficult,
Now in real time,
Um, sorry.
Sorry?
Beginner’s luck?
Maybe,
Fine,
Just great.
So your career’s still on track?
Well…no.
Well, that’s not so bad, right?
Of course I’d want you along!
Number eight, the silver one, belongs to Artemis,
Zeus, Poseidon, Hades.
Zeus got the sky,
Uh-huh.
But Hades doesn’t have a cabin here.
Well, it wouldn’t be pleasant. Let’s leave it at that.
That’s the most serious oath you can make.
And the brothers kept their word—no kids?
But that isn’t fair! It wasn’t the little girl’s fault.
Grover,
have heroes really gone on quests to the Underworld?
Sometimes,
Orpheus. Hercules. Houdini.
And have they ever returned somebody from the dead?
No,
Those are the flags?
Yeah.
Ares and Athena always lead the teams?
Not always,
But often.
So, if another cabin captures one, what do you do—repaint the flag?
You’ll see. First we have to get one.
Whose side are we on?
Heroes!
Whoa,
We’re really supposed to use these?
Blue team, forward!
Hey.
So what’s the plan?
Got any magic items you can loan me?
Just watch Clarisse’s spear,
Border patrol, whatever that means.
Okay,
Glad you wanted me on your team.
Cream the punk!
Give him a haircut,
Grab his hair.
Oh, wow,
I’m scared of this guy. Really scared.
The flag is that way,
Yeah,
You do that without my help,
No maiming,
Oops,
Guess I lost my dessert privilege.
Ah!
You idiot! You corpse-breath worm!
A trick!
It was a trick.
Not bad, hero.
Where the heck did you learn to fight like that?
You set me up,
I told you. Athena always, always has a plan.
A plan to get me pulverized.
I came as fast as I could. I was about to jump in, but…
You didn’t need help.
How did you do that?
Sword cut,
What do you think?
No. It was a sword cut. Look at it.
I—I don’t get it,
What—
Just do it.
Oh, Styx,
Stand ready! My bow!
Percy, run!
Di immortales!
Someone summoned it,
Someone inside the camp.
It’s all Percy’s fault! Percy summoned it!
Be quiet, child,
You’re wounded,
Quick, Percy, get in the water.
I’m okay.
No, you’re not,
Chiron, watch this.
Look, I—I don’t know why,
I’m sorry.…
Percy,
Um…
Your father,
This is really not good.
It is determined,
My father?
Poseidon,
lights out
You’re going to need all the training you can get,
Lights out,
Come in?
Mr. D wants to see you.
Why?
He wants to kill…I mean, I’d better let him tell you.
No,
It never rains here unless we want it to.
What the heck is that, then?
Well, well,
Our little celebrity.
Come closer,
Blah, blah, blah,
If I had my way,
Spontaneous combustion is a form of harm, Mr. D,
Nonsense,
Mr. D—
Oh, all right,
Tell me, Percy,
What did you make of the hellhound?
It scared me,
If you hadn’t shot it, I’d be dead.
You’ll meet worse, Percy. Far worse, before you’re done.
Done…with what?
Your quest, of course. Will you accept it?
Um, sir,
you haven’t told me what it is yet.
Well, that’s the hard part, the details.
Poseidon and Zeus,
How did you know that?
I knew it,
Hush, satyr,
But it is his quest!
Only the Oracle can determine.
A what?
Do not take this lightly,
Oh.
Zeus’s master bolt,
And it’s missing?
Stolen,
By who?
By whom,
At least
But I didn’t—
Patience and listen, child,
But I’ve never even been to Olympus! Zeus is crazy!
Er, Percy…?
Perhaps paranoid,
Something about a golden net?
Correct,
But I’m just a kid!
Percy,
Bad?
Bad,
And you, Percy Jackson, would be the first to feel Zeus’s wrath.
So I have to find the stupid bolt,
And return it to Zeus.
What better peace offering,
If Poseidon doesn’t have it, where is the thing?
I believe I know.
Why can’t you tell me where the bolt is beforehand?
Because if I did, you would be too afraid to accept the challenge.
Good reason.
You agree then?
All right,
It’s better than being turned into a dolphin.
Then it’s time you consulted the Oracle,
What is my destiny?
Well?
That’s great!
What did the Oracle say exactly?
This is important.
I knew it,
Anything else?
No,
That’s about it.
Okay,
Ah, think, Percy,
Somebody else who wants to take over?
Hades.
The Lord of the Dead is the only possibility.
Whoa, wait. Whwhat?
A Fury came after Percy,
Yes, but—but Hades hates all heroes,
A hellhound got into the forest,
Great,
That’s two major gods who want to kill me.
But a quest to…
Hades sent a minion to steal the master bolt,
Look, if we know it’s Hades,
Suspecting and knowing are not the same,
You’re saying I’m being used.
I had my suspicions. As I said…I’ve spoken to the Oracle, too.
So let me get this straight,
Check,
Find the most powerful weapon in the universe.
Check.
And get it back to Olympus before the summer solstice, in ten days.
That’s about right.
Did I mention that Maine is very nice this time of year?
You don’t have to go,
I can’t ask that of you.
Oh…
All the way, G-man.
Where?
Oh,
Naturally. So we just get on a plane—
No!
Percy, think,
Okay,
That’s right,
Gee,
I’ve been waiting a long time for a quest, seaweed brain,
If you do say so yourself,
I suppose you have a plan, wise girl?
Do you want my help or not?
A trio,
That’ll work.
Excellent,
No time to waste,
I think you should all get packing.
So Yesterday,
This is Argus,
Hey!
Glad I caught you.
Just wanted to say good luck,
Maia!
Awesome!
Hey, man,
Thanks.
Listen, Percy…
You’re hyperventilating.
Am not.
You let him capture the flag instead of you, didn’t you?
Oh…why do I want to go anywhere with you, Percy?
I won’t be able to use these, will I?
Me?
Maia!
Practice,
You just need practice!
Aaaaa!
That’s okay. I just wish—
What am I thinking?
Gee,
Thanks.
The sword has a long and tragic history that we need not go into,
Its name is Anaklusmos.
‘Riptide,’
Use it only for emergencies,
Good to know.
Now recap the pen.
You can’t,
Can’t what?
Lose the pen,
It may take a few moments,
Now check your pocket.
Okay, that’s extremely cool,
Mist is a powerful thing, Percy.
Mist?
Chiron…
So what was it like…before the gods?
Our destiny…assuming we know what that is.
Relax,
Relax,
I’m very relaxed.
So far so good,
Ten miles and not a single monster.
Remind me again—why do you hate me so much?
I don’t hate you.
Could’ve fooled me.
Why?
They must really like olives.
Oh, forget it.
Now, if she’d invented pizza—that I could understand.
I said, forget it!
You want to know why she married him, Percy?
Were you reading my mind or something?
Just your emotions.
Your mom married Gabe for you,
Thanks,
Where’s the nearest shower?
What is it?
I don’t know,
Maybe it’s nothing.
Percy.
She didn’t stay dead long,
I thought you said they could be dispelled for a lifetime.
I said if you’re lucky,
You’re obviously not.
All three of them,
Di immortales!
It’s okay,
They don’t open,
A back exit?
They won’t attack us with witnesses around,
Will they?
Mortals don’t have good eyes,
They’ll see three old ladies killing us, won’t they?
I need to use the rest-room.
So do I,
So do I,
I’ve got it,
Percy, take my hat.
What?
But you guys—
There’s an outside chance they might not notice us,
You’re a son of one of the Big Three. Your smell might be overpowering.
I can’t just leave you.
Don’t worry about us,
Go!
Where is it? Where?
He’s not here!
He’s gone!
Hey!
Hey—whoa!
Hey!
Perseus Jackson,
I liked you better as a math teacher,
Submit now,
And you will not suffer eternal torment.
Nice try,
Percy, look out!
Ow!
Ow! Hot! Hot!
Zeus will destroy you!
Hades will have your soul!
Braccas meas vescimini!
Eat my pants!
Get out!
Now!
Our bags!
We left our—
Run!
Three Kindly Ones. All three at once.
All our money was back there,
Well, maybe if you hadn’t decided to jump into the fight—
What did you want me to do? Let you get killed?
You didn’t need to protect me, Percy. I would’ve been fine.
Sliced like sandwich bread,
but fine.
Shut up, goat boy,
Tin cans…a perfectly good bag of tin cans.
Look, I…
We’re a team, right?
You haven’t left Camp Half-Blood since you were seven?
No…only short field trips. My dad—
The history professor.
Yeah. It didn’t work out for me living at home. I mean, Camp HalfBlood is my home.
You’re pretty good with that knife,
You think so?
Anybody who can piggyback-ride a Fury is okay by me.
You know,
Hey, my reed pipes still work!
What the heck does that say?
I don’t know,
Aunty Em’s Garden Gnome Emporium.
Hey…
The lights are on inside,
Maybe it’s open.
Snack bar,
Snack bar,
Are you two crazy?
This place is weird.
Bla-ha-ha!
Looks like my Uncle Ferdinand!
Don’t knock,
I smell monsters.
Your nose is clogged up from the Furies,
Meat!
I’m a vegetarian.
You eat cheese enchiladas and aluminum cans,
They’re…um…
We’re orphans,
Orphans?
We got separated from our caravan,
Oh, my dears,
Circus caravan?
Always have a strategy, right?
Your head is full of kelp.
Please, sit down,
Awesome,
Um,
we don’t have any money, ma’am.
Thank you, ma’am,
Quite all right, Annabeth,
What’s that hissing noise?
Hissing?
I take vitamins. For my ears.
That’s admirable,
But please, relax.
So, you sell gnomes,
Oh, yes,
A lot of business on this road?
Ah,
You make these statues yourself ?
Two sisters?
It’s a terrible story,
Percy?
Maybe we should go. I mean, the ringmaster will be waiting.
Such beautiful gray eyes,
We really should go.
Yes!
Please, dears,
A pose?
Sure we can,
Yes, Annabeth,
No harm.
Now,
Not much light for a photo,
Oh, enough,
Enough for us to see each other, yes?
Where’s your camera?
Grover,
look this way, dear.
Percy—
I will just be a moment,
Percy, something’s wrong,
Wrong?
Not at all, dear. I have such noble company tonight. What could be wrong?
That is Uncle Ferdinand!
Look away from her!
No! Don’t!
Run!
Maia!
Such a pity to destroy a handsome young face,
Stay with me, Percy. All you have to do is look up.
M.
The Gray-Eyed One did this to me, Percy,
Don’t listen to her!
Run, Percy!
Silence!
No,
Do you really want to help the gods?
Percy!
Duck!
Duck!
I’ll get her!
You miserable satyr,
I’ll add you to my collection!
That was for Uncle Ferdinand!
Arrgh!
Percy!
What? Are you crazy? Let’s get out of here.
Medusa is a menace. She’s evil. I’d kill her myself, but…
What? I can’t—
Look, do you want her turning more innocent people into statues?
Would you speak English?
I am!
Hey, guys!
Roooaaarrr!
Maybe not,
Hurry,
Ummphh!
Hey!
You wouldn’t harm an old woman, Percy,
Percy, don’t listen to her!
Too late.
Oh, yuck,
Mega-yuck.
Don’t move.
Are you okay?
Yeah,
Why didn’t…why didn’t the head evaporate?
Once you sever it, it becomes a spoil of war,
The Red Baron,
Good job, man.
So we have Athena to thank for this monster?
Oh, so now it’s my fault we met Medusa.
Forget it,
You’re impossible.
You’re insufferable.
You’re—
Hey!
I’ll be back.
Percy,
What are you—
They’re not going to like that,
I am impertinent,
Come on,
We need a new plan.
Go ahead and sleep,
I’ll wake you if there’s trouble.
It makes me sad, Percy.
What does? The fact that you signed up for this stupid quest?
No. This makes me sad.
Oh, yeah. I guess you’d be an environmentalist.
Pam? Like the cooking spray?
Pan!
Tell me about the search,
The God of Wild Places disappeared two thousand years ago,
And you want to be a searcher.
It’s my life’s dream,
Oh, right, sorry.
Hang on—the first?
Not once in two thousand years?
No.
And your dad? You have no idea what happened to him?
None.
But you still want to go,
How are we going to get into the Underworld?
I don’t know,
Oh, I forgot. Annabeth will have a plan all figured out.
What do you mean?
Forgave you for what?
Wait a minute,
I can’t talk about it,
That’s not what I mean,
They seemed plenty aggressive to me.
Asking about me,
That doesn’t make sense.
Okay, Percy. Whatever.
How about I take first watch, huh? You get some sleep.
Well,
the zombie lives.
How long was I asleep?
Long enough for me to cook breakfast.
No, he’s not.
Are you…talking to that thing?
This thing,
is our ticket west. Be nice to him.
You can talk to animals?
Percy, meet Gladiola. Gladiola, Percy.
I’m not saying hello to a pink poodle,
Forget it.
Percy,
How does Gladiola know about the reward?
He read the signs,
Duh.
Of course,
Silly me.
So we turn in Gladiola,
we get money, and we buy tickets to Los Angeles. Simple.
Not another bus,
No,
Don’t worry,
Mortal police could never find us.
So,
Who wants your help?
What do you mean?
He offered my mother in trade. Who else could do that?
This time?
You mean you’ve run into them before?
What would you do if it was your dad?
That’s easy,
I’d leave him to rot.
You’re not serious?
My dad’s resented me since the day I was born, Percy,
But how…I mean, I guess you weren’t born in a hospital.…
My mom married a really awful guy,
He doesn’t care about me,
How old were you?
Same age as when I started camp. Seven.
I want to do that,
What?
Build something like that. You ever see the Parthenon, Percy?
Only in pictures.
You? An architect?
Sorry,
That was mean.
Can’t we work together a little?
I guess…the chariot,
Then we can cooperate, too. Right?
I suppose,
Food.
Come on, goat boy,
Sightseeing.
Sightseeing?
The Gateway Arch,
As long as there’s a snack bar without monsters.
Underground,
Guys,
You know the gods’ symbols of power?
Yeah?
Well, Hade—
Um, right,
You mean the Helm of Darkness,
He was there?
It allows him to become darkness,
But then…how do we know he’s not here right now, watching us?
We don’t,
Thanks, that makes me feel a lot better,
No parents?
They’re below,
Scared of heights.
Oh, the poor darlings.
Now, now, sonny. Behave.
Sonny. Is that his name?
No,
Next car, sir.
We’ll get out,
We’ll wait with you.
Naw, it’s okay. I’ll see you guys at the bottom.
Now, now, sonny,
Doggie!
Look, a doggie!
Well, son,
If you insist.
Chimera, dear,
Isn’t that a kind of anteater?
Hey, Chihuahua!
If you are the son of Poseidon,
You have no faith,
Die, faithless one,
Father, help me,
Um…thanks.
Thank you…Father.
Where are you?
Mom?
What?
But…
Who—how did you—
Gifts?
What gifts? Wait!
Mama! That boy walked out of the river.
That’s nice, dear,
But he’s dry!
That’s nice, dear.
…an adolescent boy,
Perrr-cy!
I sort of fell.
Percy! Six hundred and thirty feet?
Gangway!
Okay, ma’am,
There he is! That’s the boy!
What’s going on?
Whoa,
First things first,
We’ve got to get out of town!
Let’s try to contact Chiron,
We can’t use phones, right?
I’m not talking about phones.
What exactly are we doing?
It’s seventy-five cents,
Don’t look at me,
The dining car wiped me out.
Excellent,
What are you talking about?
I-M’ing.
Instant messaging?
Iris-messaging,
You summon the goddess with a spray gun?
Unless you know an easier way to make a rainbow.
Drachma, please.
O goddess, accept our offering.
Half-Blood Hill,
Luke!
Percy!
We’re…uh…fine,
He’s down at the cabins.
I’m right here,
What kind of issues?
Chiron had to—what’s that noise?
I’ll take care of it!
Grover, come on!
What?
But—
Give Percy the nozzle and come on!
Chiron had to break up a fight,
So what’s your status?
I wish I could be there,
But Chiron said the gods can’t take each other’s magic items directly.
That’s true,
Oh, hey,
You’d better go see what that was,
Oh…uh, yeah!
Really?
They fit and everything?
Well, take care of yourself out there in Denver,
Not much,
Come on, let’s find some dinner.
Well?
We, um, want to order dinner.
You kids have money to pay for it?
It’s on me.
So you’re old Seaweed’s kid, huh?
What’s it to you?
Percy, this is—
S’okay,
You’re Clarisse’s dad,
Ares, god of war.
That’s right, punk. I heard you broke Clarisse’s spear.
She was asking for it.
But, these aren’t…
Problem, sweetheart?
You can’t do that,
What favor could I do for a god?
Why don’t you go back and get it yourself ?
We’re not interested,
We’ve already got a quest.
You told him Hades stole the bolt?
Thanks,
We’re doing fine on our own.
My mom?
What interrupted your date?
Something scare you off ?
Not good,
Ares sought you out, Percy. This is not good.
It’s probably some kind of trick,
Forget Ares. Let’s just go.
We can’t,
Why does he need us?
Maybe it’s a problem that requires brains,
I’m afraid we’ll have to find out.
If Ares brings his girlfriend here for a date,
I’d hate to see what she looks like.
Percy,
Be more respectful.
Why? I thought you hated Ares.
He’s still a god. And his girlfriend is very temperamental.
You don’t want to insult her looks,
No, Aphrodite,
Goddess of love.
I thought she was married to somebody,
Hephaestus.
What’s your point?
Oh.
So how do we get in?
Maia!
You guys coming?
Clothes,
Fresh clothes.
Yeah,
But you can’t just—
Watch me.
What the heck.
So Ares and Aphrodite,
they have a thing going?
That’s old gossip, Percy,
What about Aphrodite’s husband?
Well, you know,
She likes bikers.
Whatever.
Hephaestus knows?
Oh sure,
Like that.
Guys, look.
This is too easy,
So we just walk down there and get it?
There’s a Greek letter carved here,
Eta. I wonder…
Grover,
you smell any monsters?
Nothing.
I told you, that was underground.
Okay, I’m sorry.
I’m going down there.
I’ll go with you.
No,
Sure. But what could go wrong?
I don’t know. Just a feeling. Annabeth, come with me—
Are you kidding?
What’s the problem now?
Who’s going to see you?
Fine,
I’ll do it myself.
What?
Just get the shield, Seaweed Brain, and let’s get out of here.
Wait,
Too late.
Guys!
We have to get out,
Duh!
Come on!
Live to Olympus in one minute…Fifty-nine seconds, fiftyeight…
Hephaestus!
Spiders!
Sp—sp—aaaah!
Thirty, twenty-nine,
Fifteen, fourteen,
Grover!
Get into that booth! Find the ‘on’ switch!
But—
Do it!
Five, four—
Two, one, zero!
Unfasten your seat belt,
Are you crazy?
Unless you want to get smashed to death.
We’re going to have to jump for it.
On my mark,
No! On my mark!
What?
Simple physics!
Force times the trajectory angle—
Fine!
On your mark!
Now!
Ouch!
You’re too heavy!
We’re going down!
Show’s over!
Thank you! Good night!
We need to have a little talk with Ares.
Well, well,
You didn’t get yourself killed.
You knew it was a trap,
You’re a jerk.
See that truck over there?
You’re kidding.
I don’t want your lousy—
Thank you, Lord Ares,
Thanks a lot.
You owe me one more thing,
You promised me information about my mother.
You sure you can handle the news?
She’s not dead.
What do you mean?
Kept. Why?
Nobody’s controlling me.
Oh yeah? See you around, kid.
That was not smart, Percy.
I don’t care.
You don’t want a god as your enemy. Especially not that god.
Hey, guys,
I hate to interrupt, but…
If we’re taking the zoo express,
we need to hurry.
This is kindness?
Humane zoo transport?
Hey,
That’s okay.
It’s just…
Spiders.
Because of the Arachne story,
We’re a team, remember?
I should’ve told you the truth from the beginning.
I thought if you knew what a failure I was, you wouldn’t want me along.
You were the satyr who tried to rescue Thalia, the daughter of Zeus.
That was you and Luke, wasn’t it?
I was supposed to escort Thalia to camp,
Stop it,
She sacrificed herself to save us,
Because you wouldn’t leave two other half-bloods behind?
That’s not fair.
Percy’s right,
You’re not lame,
Yeah,
How does he do that?
I don’t know,
I meant it.
That pine-tree bead,
Is that from your first year?
Yeah,
And the college ring is your father’s?
That’s none of your—
Yeah. Yeah, it is.
You don’t have to tell me.
No…it’s okay.
That doesn’t sound so bad.
You think you’ll ever try living with your dad again?
Please. I’m not into self-inflicted pain.
You shouldn’t give up,
Thanks for the advice,
So if the gods fight,
I don’t know what my mom will do. I just know I’ll fight next to you.
Why?
Because you’re my friend, Seaweed Brain. Any more stupid questions?
The truck’s stopped,
Hide!
Man!
I wish I hauled appliances.
You hot, big boy?
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
What do you want, Eddie?
What are you banging for?
What banging?
No kidding,
We’ve got to free them!
Hey! You need a permit for that!
Now would be a good time to leave,
The other animals first,
Good luck,
Will the animals be okay?
Don’t worry,
I placed a satyr’s sanctuary on them.
Meaning?
Meaning they’ll reach the wild safely,
Why can’t you place a blessing like that on us?
It only works on wild animals.
So it would only affect Percy,
Hey!
Kidding,
Come on. Let’s get out of this filthy truck.
Whoa.
Hey!
Welcome to the Lotus Casino. Here’s your room key.
Um, but…
No, no,
How much is on here?
What do you mean?
I mean, when does it run out of cash?
Oh, goodness,
This place is…
Sweet,
Absolutely sweet.
All those stations,
It’s interesting.
I feel good,
I love this place.
So what now?
Sleep?
Play time,
sick,
Hey, Darrin?
What?
What year is it?
In the game?
No. In real life.
1977.
No,
Really.
Hey, man. Bad vibes. I got a game happening.
Come on,
We’ve got to get out of here.
Annabeth?
What?
We need to leave.
Leave? What are you talking about? I’ve just got the towers—
This place is a trap.
What?
Listen. The Underworld. Our quest!
Oh, come on, Percy. Just a few more minutes.
So?
Can you imagine a better place?
Hey!
Oh my gods,
I don’t know, but we’ve got to find Grover.
Grover!
Die, human! Die, silly polluting nasty person!
Grover!
No! I just got to a new level! No!
We’re leaving,
Such a shame,
No, thanks.
Los Angeles, please.
You accept casino debit cards?
Swipe it,
Where to in Los Angeles…uh, Your Highness?
The Santa Monica Pier.
Your Highness
my lord
The Silent One?
Maybe…
That throne room sounds like Hades’s,
What?
Like what?
I—I don’t know,
But if I’d already retrieved the bolt,
To threaten Hades,
You have evil thoughts for a goat.
Why, thank you.
But the thing in the pit said it was waiting for two items,
You have an idea what might be in that pit, don’t you?
The answer is in the Underworld,
What now?
Percy?
What are you doing?
Percy Jackson.
You’ve come far, Percy Jackson. Well done.
And…you serve in Poseidon’s court?
If my father is so interested in me,
Do not judge the Lord of the Sea too harshly,
Even to their own children?
I know you journey to Hades’s realm,
Um…no, ma’am.
What will happen?
That,
What about the warning?
Wait!
At the river, you said not to trust the gifts. What gifts?
Good-bye, young hero,
You must listen to your heart.
No gift comes without a price.
They were free.
No.
You remind me of somebody I saw on TV,
Uh…I’m a stunt double…for a lot of child actors.
Oh! That explains it.
There you have it, America.
Who are the other children in this photo?
C’mon,
Hey, you.
Run!
There!
Crusty’s Water Bed Palace?
I think we lost them,
Lost who?
I’m Crusty,
Sorry to barge in,
We were just, um, browsing.
You mean hiding from those no-good kids,
This is my most popular model.
Million-hand massage,
Um,
I don’t think…
Million-hand massage!
Hmm,
Almost, almost.
Almost what?
But what—
Hey!
Ergo!
N-not c-c-cool!
N-not c-cool a-at all!
Almost, darn it.
Whoa, kid. Don’t worry. We’ll find you one in a sec.
Let my friends go.
Oh, sure I will. But I got to make them fit, first.
What do you mean?
Can’t stand imperfect measurements,
Ergo!
Don’t worry,
Percy!
Your real name’s not Crusty, is it?
Legally, it’s Procrustes,
The Stretcher,
Yeah,
You’re right. It’s got a good ring to it.
You think so?
Oh, absolutely,
Not too many.
That’s right!
Percy!
What are you doing?
Don’t mind her,
She’s impossible.
What do you do if they’re longer than six feet?
Oh, that happens all the time. It’s a simple fix.
Ah,
Sensible.
I’m so glad to come across an intelligent customer!
So, Crusty…
Absolutely. Try it out.
Guaranteed.
No way.
Way.
Show me.
No waves. See?
Ergo.
Hey!
Center him just right,
No!
Wait! This is just a demo.
A few simple adjustments…
You drive a hard bargain,
I think I’ll start with the top.
No money down! No interest for six months!
You look taller,
Very funny,
Be faster next time.
Come on,
Give us a minute,
Then you’re ready for the Underworld,
Okay. You remember the plan.
The plan,
Yeah. I love the plan.
What happens if the plan doesn’t work?
Don’t think negative.
Right,
Oh, right!
What a precious young lad.
N-no.
Sir,
Sir,
Charon.
Amazing! Now: Mr. Charon.
Mr. Charon,
Well done.
I hate being confused with that old horseman. And now, how may I help you little dead ones?
We want to go the Underworld,
Well, that’s refreshing.
It is?
How did you die, then?
Oh,
Um…drowned…in the bathtub.
All three of you?
Big bathtub.
Oh, but we have coins.
Well, now…
Here now,
No,
I’m dead.
We have to get to the Underworld,
Leave while you can,
No service, no tip.
It’s a shame, too,
We had more to offer.
A lot,
You deserve better,
Come along.
Freeloaders.
Right. Now, no one get any ideas while I’m gone,
What happens to the spirits waiting in the lobby?
Nothing,
For how long?
Forever, or until I’m feeling generous.
Oh,
That’s…fair.
We’ll get out alive,
Ha.
Well?
Nothing,
I think I’m getting seasick.
The River Styx,
It’s so…
Polluted,
Old Three-Face is hungry,
Bad luck for you, godlings.
What do you figure?
The fast line must go straight to the Asphodel Fields,
There’s a court for dead people?
And do what?
Imagine standing in a wheat field in Kansas. Forever.
Harsh,
Not as harsh as that,
Look.
He’s that preacher who made the news, remember?
Oh, yeah.
Lamborghini for the Lord
What’re they doing to him?
Special punishment from Hades,
But if he’s a preacher,
and he believes in a different hell.…
He’s a Rottweiler.
I’m starting to see him better,
Why is that?
I think…
It can smell the living,
But that’s okay,
Right,
A plan.
Can you understand it?
Oh yeah,
I can understand it.
What’s it saying?
I don’t think humans have a four-letter word that translates, exactly.
Hey, Big Fella,
I bet they don’t play with you much.
GROWWWLLLL!
Good boy,
Fetch!
Um,
Percy?
Yeah?
I just thought you’d want to know.
Yeah?
Wait!
Five seconds,
Do we run now?
See the ball? You want the ball, Cerberus? Sit!
Sit!
Good boy!
Drop it!
Good boy.
Go now. EZ DEATH line—it’s faster.
But—
Now!
Stay!
If you want the ball, stay!
What about you?
I know what I’m doing, Percy,
Good dog!
How did you do that?
Obedience school,
Never mind that,
Come on!
Good boy,
I’ll bring you another ball soon,
Good dog. I’ll come visit you soon. I—I promise.
Let’s go.
Well, Percy, what have we learned today?
That three-headed dogs prefer red rubber balls over sticks?
No,
We’ve learned that your plans really, really bite!
That’s what it’s all about,
That’s the place for heroes.
I suppose it’s too late to turn back,
We’ll be okay.
Maybe we should search some of the other places first,
Like, Elysium, for instance…
Come on, goat boy.
Grover,
Stop messing around.
But I didn’t—
Maia!
Untie the shoes!
Grover!
Hold on to something!
What?
Come on, Percy!
But that’s—
I know!
I don’t know how…
I didn’t…
Wait,
Listen.
Percy, this place—
Shh.
Wh—what’s that noise?
Magic,
We have to get out of here,
What was that?
One of Hades’s pets?
Let’s keep going.
Can you walk?
Yeah, sure. I never liked those shoes, anyway.
The garden of Persephone,
Keep walking.
You know,
Well, guys,
I suppose we should…knock?
I guess that means entrez-vous,
You are brave to come here, Son of Poseidon,
Only two requests?
Lord Hades,
Really bad,
Return Zeus’s master bolt to me,
Um…Uncle,
Do you think I want war, godling?
You are the Lord of the Dead,
Well…
More security ghouls,
Charon wants a pay raise,
Don’t get me started on Charon!
But you took Zeus’s master bolt.
Lies!
His plan?
You were the thief on the winter solstice,
But…
Lord Hades, your helm of darkness is missing, too?
No!
Poseidon didn’t—I didn’t—
I have said nothing of the helm’s disappearance,
You didn’t try to stop us? But—
Return my helm now, or I will stop death,
You’re as bad as Zeus,
Of course,
And the other monsters?
Easily?
Return my property!
But I don’t have your helm. I came for the master bolt.
Which you already possess!
But I didn’t!
Open your pack, then.
Percy,
How—
I—I don’t know. I don’t understand.
You heroes are always the same,
Lord Hades, wait,
This is all a mistake.
A mistake?
There is no mistake,
Yes,
Ah, the pearls,
Only three,
We were tricked,
Set up.
Yes, but why?
And the voice in the pit—
I don’t know yet,
But I intend to ask.
Decide, boy!
Percy.
I know that.
Leave me here,
Use the third pearl on your mom.
No!
I’m a satyr,
No.
No way,
I’m staying behind.
Think again, goat boy,
Stop it, both of you!
I know what to do,
Take these.
But, Percy…
I’m sorry,
I’ll be back. I’ll find a way.
Godling…?
I’ll find your helm, Uncle,
Do not defy me—
Percy Jackson, you will not—
Now, guys!
Destroy them!
Look up!
We’re going to crash!
How do you control these things?
I don’t think you do!
Dude!
Beat it.
I don’t believe it,
We went all that way—
It was a trick,
A strategy worthy of Athena.
Hey,
You get it, don’t you?
Yeah. I get it.
Well, I don’t!
Would somebody—
Percy…
I’m sorry about your mother. I’m so sorry.…
The prophecy was right,
Gee, let me think.
Hey, kid,
You tricked me,
You stole the helm and the master bolt.
Who did you use? Clarisse? She was there at the winter solstice.
The helm of darkness,
Exactly,
But they’re your family!
You gave me the backpack in Denver,
Yes and no,
Anyway,
But why not just keep the master bolt for yourself ?
You’re lying,
Of course it was!
You didn’t order the theft,
I am the god of war! I take orders from no one! I don’t have dreams!
Who said anything about dreams?
Fight me yourself, Ares.
Scared?
In your adolescent dreams.
Percy, run!
Wave!
Are you going to fight me now?
Watch it, kid. I could turn you into—
A cockroach,
That’s cool, dead boy,
Classic it is.
Percy,
Don’t do this. He’s a god.
He’s a coward,
Wear this, at least. For luck.
Reconciliation,
Athena and Poseidon together.
Thanks.
And take this,
Grover…I don’t know what to say.
You all done saying good-bye?
Not bad, not bad.
Percy!
Cops!
There, officer!
See?
Looks like that kid on TV…what the heck…
That guy’s armed,
Call for backup.
Admit it, kid,
You got no hope. I’m just toying with you.
This is a private matter!
Be gone!
You have made an enemy, godling,
Percy!
Don’t watch!
We saw the whole thing,
So…it truly was not you?
Return that to Lord Hades,
Percy…
That was so incredibly…
Terrifying,
Cool!
Did you guys feel that…whatever it was?
Must’ve been the Furies overhead,
We have to get back to New York,
By tonight.
That’s impossible,
unless we—
Fly,
Yeah,
Pretty much exactly like that. Come on.
Why didn’t I remember him before?
All I want,
Six hundredth floor.
No such floor, kiddo.
I need an audience with Zeus.
Sorry?
You heard me.
Oh, I think he’ll make an exception.
That isn’t…
Yes, it is,
You want me take it out and—
No! No!
Raindrops keep falling on my head.…
Father.
Peace, brother,
The boy defers to his father. This is only right.
You still claim him then?
I have admitted my wrongdoing,
I have spared him once already,
And risk destroying your own master bolt?
Let us hear him out, brother.
I shall listen,
Perseus,
Look at me.
Address Lord Zeus, boy,
Tell him your story.
I sense the boy tells the truth,
He is proud and impulsive,
It runs in the family.
Lord?
Yes?
In the dreams,
You are accusing Hades, after all?
No,
I had help, sir,
Grover Underwood and Annabeth Chase—
Um…thank you, sir.
Your uncle,
Sir,
what was in that pit?
Have you not guessed?
Kronos,
The king of the Titans.
He’s healing,
He’s coming back.
That’s what he intends, Father. That’s what he said.
But—
No…sir.
You must go, child. But first, know that your mother has returned.
My mother?
Do you…would you…
A package?
Your mother is a queen among women,
I don’t mind, Father.
Not yet, perhaps,
I’ll leave you then.
I—I won’t bother you again.
Perseus.
Percy! Oh, thank goodness. Oh, my baby.
Hey, Sally! That meat loaf done yet or what?
Oh, yeah. About that…
He’s not a fugitive after all,
Bad enough I had to give back your life insurance money, Sally,
Get me the phone. I’ll call the cops.
Gabe, no!
But—
Hey, Gabe,
He’s just a kid.
I’ll be nice to you, punk.
Gabe!
He ran away,
Let him stay gone.
Gabe is just upset, honey,
Mom, it’ll never work out. Not as long as Gabe’s here.
Mom.
I’m trying, Percy. I just…I need some time.
Mom, do you want Gabe gone?
Percy, it isn’t that simple. I—
I can do it,
You can’t.
Poseidon called you a queen,
Percy—
You sound so much like your father,
What’s wrong with that?
I’ll leave the box,
If he threatens you…
Where will you go, Percy?
Half-Blood Hill.
For the summer…or forever?
I guess that depends.
Leaving so soon, punk?
Good riddance.
Hey, Sally,
What about that meat loaf, huh?
The meat loaf is coming right up, dear,
I’m off,
I just came to say…well, you know.
Kind of a secret,
We understand,
You got enough tin cans for the trip?
Yeah.
And you remembered your reed pipes?
Jeez, Annabeth,
You’re like an old mama goat.
Well,
wish me luck.
Hey, Grover,
Wherever you’re going—I hope they make good enchiladas.
We’ll see him again,
The choice was unanimous,
Percy.
Um, sorry,
I just—
It’s okay,
Those dummies won’t be bothering anybody anymore.
We build new ones every summer.
Oh, this? New toy. This is Backbiter.
Backbiter?
I didn’t know they could make weapons like that.
They probably can’t,
It’s one of a kind.
You think it’s a good idea?
I mean—
Aw, come on.
Drinks are on me.
Sure,
Why not?
You miss being on a quest?
With monsters attacking me every three feet? Are you kidding?
Yeah, I miss it,
You?
I’ve lived at Half-Blood Hill year-round since I was fourteen,
The heck with laurel wreaths,
You make it sound like you’re leaving.
I wouldn’t,
Luke, what—
You,
I saw a lot out there in the world, Percy,
Luke…you’re talking about our parents,
You’re as crazy as Ares.
Kronos,
That’s who you serve.
You should be careful with names,
He’s brainwashing you, Luke.
That’s not an easy quest,
Hercules did it.
Exactly,
You summoned the hellhound, that night in the forest.
The flying shoes were cursed,
Thalia gave her life to save you,
Don’t speak of Thalia!
You’re being used, Luke. You and Ares both. Don’t listen to Kronos.
I’ve been used?
Call off the bug,
If you’re so strong, fight me yourself.
Luke—
Help,
Please…
Here we are again,
You idiot,
Now, now,
How are you feeling?
Like my insides have been frozen, then microwaved.
I can’t believe that Luke…
This must be reported to Olympus,
Luke is out there right now,
I have to go after him.
No, Percy. The gods—
Won’t even talk about Kronos,
Percy, it isn’t my place—
You’ve been ordered not to talk to me about it, haven’t you?
All right!
Fine!
We can’t just sit back and do nothing,
We will not sit back,
Assuming I live that long.
I’ll be back as soon as I can,
Who’s here?
What’s wrong?
Nothing.
Yeah. Help me up. I want to go outside.
Percy, that isn’t a good idea.
I told you…
I’m fine,
What are you going to do?
I don’t know.
You mean, to your dad’s?
I wrote him a letter when we got back,
That took guts.
When I get back next summer,
Sounds like a plan worthy of Athena.
Take care, Seaweed Brain,
Keep your eyes open.
You too, Wise Girl.
I’ll be back next summer,
MIIIIINE!
Come on, dear,
Coming,
Percy, are you all right?
Yeah…fine.
School, or…
I think Grover’s in trouble,
I wouldn’t be too worried, dear,
What is it?
Nothing,
Wait a minute,
Usually, dear. But with the problems they’re having—
What problems?
But—
Percy, we’ll talk this afternoon. Go on to school.
Who’s after me?
Not sure.
Where’d you see these people with the flyers?
That makes no sense. Who—
I don’t know, kid, but I gotta go.
I appreciate it,
I’ll be fine.
Why?
They’re coming.
Unbelievable,
I want to strangle him.
But two years?
I can’t explain Randolph’s actions. I never could, Annabeth.
—to find Magnus,
How do we even know Magnus is alive?
Missing for two years? He could be frozen in a ditch somewhere!
Randolph is sure,
MIIIIINE!
Percy, you’re going to be late
Come on, dear,
Coming,
Percy, are you all right?
Yeah … fine.
School, or …
I think Grover’s in trouble,
I wouldn’t be too worried, dear,
What is it?
Nothing,
Wait a minute,
I thought we were packing me up for camp tonight.
Ah, dear, about that … I got a message from Chiron last night.
What did he say?
He thinks … it might not be safe for you to come to camp just yet. We might have to postpone.
What problems?
Seven-thirty, dear. You should go. Tyson will be waiting.
Percy, we’ll talk this afternoon. Go on to school.
We’ll talk this afternoon, dear. I’ll explain … as much as I can.
progressive
You freak!
Why don’t you go back to your cardboard box!
Take it back, Sloan!
He’s not a freak. He’s just…
Just wait till PE, Jackson,
You are so dead.
I … I am a freak?
No,
Matt Sloan is the freak.
You are a good friend. Miss you next year if … if I can’t …
Don’t worry, big guy,
Everything’s going to be fine.
Hey!
Give it back!
These guys are moving here next year,
He’s not retarded.
You’re such a loser, Jackson. Good thing I’m gonna put you out of your misery next period.
Percy!
Percy?
Will you … uh …
Oh. Yeah.
Yeah, sure, man.
Coach, can I be captain?
Eh?
Yeah,
Mm-hmm.
Scared,
Smell funny.
What smells funny?
Them.
Smell funny.
I have to go potty!
Tyson,
Percy, duck!
Hey!
You could kill somebody!
I hope so, Perseus Jackson! I hope so!
Whoa! You’re not from Detroit! Who …
Let them go!
Coach!
Yeah. Mm-hmm,
Play nice.
Corey!
Run!
The other exit!
No one leaves unless you’re out!
And you’re not out until we eat you!
Flesh!
Hero flesh for lunch!
Percy needs help!
Tyson!
BAAAAAD!
My brothers!
You will pay for their destruction!
Tyson!
Look out!
Victory will be ours!
We will feast on your bones!
Move!
Away from the door.
No!
Well!
Stop!
It’s me you want!
You wish to die first, young hero?
My lunch approaches.
Ow,
And you,
Annabeth …
How did you … how long have you …
Pretty much all morning.
The shadow I saw this morning-that was-
There’s no time to explain!
There!
Meet me outside,
And him.
What?
No time!
Hurry!
Percy Jackson?
What … how …
Eh? Yeah. Mm-hmm.
Come on!
Where’d you find him?
He’s my friend,
Is he homeless?
What does that have to do with anything? He can hear you, you know. Why don’t you ask him?
He can talk?
I talk,
You are pretty.
Ah! Gross!
Tyson,
Your hands aren’t even burned.
Of course not,
Annabeth,
what are you talking about? Laistry-what?
Laistry-I can’t even say that. What would you call them in English?
Canadians,
The police’ll be after me.
That’s the least of our problems,
Have you been having the dreams?
The dreams … about Grover?
Grover? No, what about Grover?
Why? What were you dreaming about?
Camp,
Big trouble at camp.
My mom was saying the same thing! But what kind of trouble?
None all year … until today.
None? But how …
Oh.
What do you mean, ‘oh’?
Big guy,
Yes,
Yes,
Uh, well, Annabeth and I are half-bloods,
Yes.
So … you believe me?
But you are … Son of the Sea God?
Yeah,
My dad is Poseidon.
But then …
We don’t have time for this,
We’ll talk in the taxi.
A taxi all the way to camp?
Trust me.
What about Tyson?
We can’t just leave him,
He’ll be in trouble, too.
Yeah.
We definitely need to take him. Now come on.
Here.
I hope I have one left.
What are you looking for?
Found one. Thank the gods.
Annabeth,
New York taxi drivers won’t take that.
Stêthi,
Ô hárma diabolês!
Passage? Passage?
Three to Camp Half-Blood,
Ach!
We don’t take his kind!
Extra pay,
Three more drachma on arrival.
Done!
Long Island! Out-of-metro fare bonus! Ha!
Look out! Go left!
Well, if you’d give me the eye, Tempest, I could see that!
Wasp!
Give me the girl’s coin! I want to bite it.
You bit it last time, Anger!
It’s my turn!
Is not!
Red light!
Brake!
Excuse me,
But … can you see?
No!
No!
Of course!
They’re blind?
Not completely,
They have an eye.
One eye?
Yeah.
Each?
No. One eye total.
Not feeling so good.
Oh, man,
Hey,
Gray Sisters Taxi is the fastest way to camp.
Then why didn’t you take it from Virginia?
That’s outside their service area,
We’ve had famous people in this cab!
Jason! You remember him?
Don’t remind me!
Give me the tooth!
Only if Tempest gives me the eye!
No!
You had it yesterday!
But I’m driving, you old hag!
Excuses! Turn! That was your turn!
‘Ivit back! ‘Ivit back!
Uh, if anybody’s interested,
we’re going to die!
Don’t worry,
Yes, wise!
Every street in Manhattan!
The capital of Nepal!
The location you seek!
What?
Nothing!
You’re right, boy. It’s nothing!
Tell me.
No!
The last time we told, it was horrible!
Eye tossed in a lake!
Years to find it again!
And speaking of that-give it back!
No!
Eye!
Gimme!
I can’t see!
Give me the eye!
Give her the eye!
I don’t have it!
There, by your foot,
Don’t step on it! Get it!
I’m not picking that up!
Going to be sick!
Annabeth,
let Tyson use your backpack!
Are you crazy? Get the eye!
Nice boy!
Give it back!
Not until you explain,
What were you talking about, the location I seek?
No time!
Accelerating!
Percy,
First they have to tell me,
No!
Too dangerous!
I’m rolling down the window.
Wait!
30, 31, 75, 12!
What do you mean?
That makes no sense!
30, 31, 75, 12!
Percy!
Give them the eye now!
Whoa!
Better now.
All right,
Now tell me what those numbers mean.
No time!
We have to get out now.
Oh, man,
Border patrol, to me!
It’s Clarisse,
Come on, we have to help her.
to do
Tyson, stay here. I don’t want you taking any more chances.
No!
We need him.
Medea’s what?
Look, I don’t know what you’re talking about, but I’m not going to let Tyson get fried.
Tyson, stay back.
I’m going in.
Hold the line!
Behind you!
Look out!
Let me go!
Percy, curse you!
Tyson, help him!
Can’t-get-through!
I, Annabeth Chase, give you permission to enter camp!
Tyson!
BAD COW!
Down!
The other bull?
You-ruin-everything!
Good to see you too, Clarisse.
Argh!
Don’t ever, EVER try saving me again!
Clarisse,
you’ve got wounded campers.
I’ll be back,
You didn’t die.
I am sorry. Came to help. Disobeyed you.
My fault,
Let him cross the boundary line?’
Percy,
Tyson,
You’re a …
Cyclops,
One of the what?
They’re in almost all the big cities,
He’s a Cyclops.
Tantalus?
The activities director,
Chiron is the activities director. And where’s Argus? He’s head of security. He should be here.
That happened,
clean
Welcome back.
Whasthat!
The stables for pegasi,
The winged horses.
Whasthat!
Um … those are the toilets.
Whasthat!
You … have a cabin?
Number three.
You live with friends in the cabin?
No. No, just me.
Big Three
Big Three
Pony!
I beg your pardon?
Chiron, what’s happening? You’re not … leaving?
Clarisse said you were … you were …
Fired.
Besides himself, you mean,
But this is crazy!
Nevertheless,
some in Olympus do not trust me now, under the circumstances.
What circumstances?
Pony?
My dear young Cyclops! I am a centaur.
Chiron,
What about the tree? What happened?
Do not invoke the titan lord’s name, Percy. Especially not here, not now.
Perhaps,
Unless what?
No,
What is it?
We’ll go find it!
Why?
Overrun by monsters,
Keep him safe. The prophecy-remember it!
I-I will.
Um …
Right,
Just checking.
Chiron …
Swear you will do your best to keep Percy from danger,
I-I swear it upon the River Styx,
Very well,
Who is this Tantalus guy, anyway?
Where does he get off taking your job?
Go,
Stoll,
Who invited that?
Percy Jackson … sir.
Yes. Well, as you young people say these days: Whatever.
This boy,
you need to watch. Poseidon’s child, you know.
Ah!
That one.
I am Tantalus,
Trouble?
Yes, trouble,
Go on, then, old fellow,
Blast!
Ah, well,
Eventually,
You’re that spirit from the Fields of Punishment,
A real scholar, aren’t you, boy?
You must’ve done something really horrible when you were alive,
What was it?
I’ll be watching you, Percy Jackson,
I don’t want any problems at my camp.
Your camp has problems already … sir.
Oh, go sit down, Johnson,
Come on, Tyson.
Oh, no,
The monster stays here. We must decide what to do with it.
Him,
His name is Tyson.
Tyson saved the camp,
Yes,
and what a pity that would’ve been.
Leave us,
while we decide this creature’s fate.
I’ll be right over here, big guy,
I believe you. You are my friend.
Poseidon,
accept my offering.
Yes, well,
Another fine meal! Or so I am told.
And here on my first day of authority,
And now some changes!
Now I know,
Three deaths and twenty-six mutilations,
Yes, yes!
But, sir!
Ah, the hero of the day,
And modest, too.
And now,
Now, of course,
Come now,
Percy is my brother?
Aw, Tyson,
It’s not that simple.
He’s not my real brother!
He’s more like a halfbrother on the monstrous side of the family. Like … a half-brother twice removed, or something.
Oh sorry, eyes.
He’s not my brother!
And he’s not a monster, either!
Hey, don’t get mad at me! And technically, he is a monster.
Well you gave him permission to enter the camp.
Just forget it,
You’re treating him like he’s this horrible thing,
He saved my life.
Then maybe you should design a chariot with him.
Maybe I should.
Fine!
Fine!
chicken ponies,
You are mad?
Nah. I’m not mad.
I am a monster.
Don’t say that.
It is okay. I will be a good monster. Then you will not have to be mad.
It’s just… I never had a half-brother before.
I’m sorry,
Good night, big guy.
Thank the gods!
Percy?
I hear you,
Grover, what’s going on?
Honeypie! Are you done yet?
Not quite, dearest! A few more days!
Bah! Hasn’t it been two weeks yet?
N-no, dearest. Just five days. That leaves twelve more to go.
All right, but hurry! I want to SEEEEE under that veil, heh-heh-heh.
Where?
I don’t know exactly! I went to Florida and turned left.
It’s a trap!
Poly-who?
The Cyclops!
But he followed you,
That’s right,
Yes!
He thinks I’m a lady Cyclops and he wants to marry me!
I’ll come rescue you,
Where are you?
The Sea of Monsters, of course!
The sea of what?
Don’t tell me, I’ll die too.
Honeypie!
Dinnertime! Yummy yummy sheep meat!
I have to go. Hurry!
Wait! You said ‘it’ was here. What?
Sweet dreams. Don’t let me die!
Are you okay?
Right!
You’re trying to distract me,
What? No I’m not!
What do you mean?
Go back to your chariot, Percy.
I’m not making this up. He’s in trouble, Annabeth.
Percy, an empathy link is so hard to do. I mean, it’s more likely you really were dreaming.
The Oracle,
We could consult the Oracle.
Charioteers!
To your mark!
We’ll talk later,
after I win.
No hitting ponies with the stick,
No,
We will win.’
Charioteers!
Attend your mark!
See ya!
Sorry, Percy!
Nice work, Tyson!
Birds!
What?
Stymphalian birds!
They’ll strip everyone to bones if we don’t drive them away!
Tyson,
we’re turning around!
Going the wrong way?
Always,
Heroes, to arms!
Too many!
How do you get rid of them?
Percy … Chiron’s collection!
You think it’ll work?
To the Big House! It’s our only chance!
You’re running? The fight is here, cowards!
Everything’s under control! Not to worry.’
Now!
Archers!
Bravo!
We have our first winner!
And now to punish the troublemakers who disrupted this race.
If he’s really found it,
Hold on,
I’ll give you a hint. What do you get when you skin a ram?
Messy?
The Golden Fleece. Are you serious?
Yeah,
That old movie with the clay skeletons.
Oh my gods, Percy! You are so hopeless.
What?
It was probably important to her.
It could cure Thalia’s tree.
But Grover found it,
A little too perfect, don’t you think? What if it’s a trap?
What choice do we have?
Are you going to help me rescue Grover or not?
Percy,
Where’s that?
You mean the Mediterranean?
No. Well, yes … but no.
Another straight answer. Thanks.
Like Mount Olympus being above the Empire State Building,
Right.
The Bermuda Triangle?
Exactly.
Okay … so at least we know where to look.
Hey, I’m the son of the sea god. This is my home turf. How hard can it be?
Maybe.
Down by the Aegean,
I Am My Own Great-GreatGreat-Great-Grandpa,
This Land is Minos’s Land.
Well, that was lovely!
Sir,
Our kitchen boy has something to say?
We have an idea to save the camp.
Indeed,
The Golden Fleece,
We know where it is.
The Fleece can save the camp,
I’m certain of it.
Nonsense,
We don’t need saving.
Besides,
Yes, I would,
You would?
30, 31, 75, 12,
Ooo-kay,
Thank you for sharing those meaningless numbers.
They’re sailing coordinates,
Wait just a minute,
We need a quest! We need a quest!
It isn’t necessary!
WE NEED A QUEST! WE NEED A QUEST!
Fine!
You brats want me to assign a quest?
YES!
Very well,
I will allow our champion to consult the Oracle!
CLARISSE! CLARISSE!
Wait!
Grover is my friend. The dream came to me.
Sit down!
You had your chance last summer!
Yeah, he just wants to be in the spotlight again!
I accept the quest!
Silence, you brats!
Sit down!
And I will tell you a ghost story.
Once upon a time there was a mortal king who was beloved of the Gods!
This king,
Do you know what he did to his ungrateful children?
Oh, the gods punished him in the afterlife,
The Oracle, my dear. Go on.
Go!
What about you, Percy Jackson?
No comments from our dishwasher?
Good,
You will go anyway?
I don’t know,
It would be hard. Very hard.
I will help.
No. I-uh, I couldn’t ask you to do that, big guy. Too dangerous.
What are you building?
Oh, that’s not it,
Annabeth likes you. Really.
Daddy always cared for m-me,
Don’t talk that way! Poseidon claimed you, didn’t he? So … he must care about you … a lot….
Tyson … camp will be a good home for you. The others will get used to you. I promise.
Beautiful, aren’t they?
May I join you?
I haven’t sat down in ages.
Uh, sure.
Your hospitality does you credit. Oh, and Coca-Cola! May I?
Hello?
Yeah,
You have snakes on your phone.
What? Oh, they don’t bite. Say hello, George and Martha.
Oh, let’s not go into that again!
Uh, I like Hercules.
Why?
Well … because he had rotten luck. Even worse than mine. It makes me feel better.
Not because he was strong and famous and all that?
No.
You’re an interesting young man. And so, what now?
Not now,
Tell her to leave a message.
Just tell her I’m in a meeting!
Um … who are you, exactly?
Haven’t you guessed by now, a smart boy like you?
Original form, please.
You’re Luke’s father,
Hermes.
Behave, you two,
I-I don’t have permission to go.
No, indeed. Will that stop you?
I want to go. I have to save Grover.
I knew a boy once … oh, younger than you by far. A mere baby, really.
Did he get blasted to tiny pieces?
So what’s the moral?
The moral?
Um …
How about this: stealing is not always bad?
I don’t think my mom would like that moral.
I’ve got it,
You’re saying I should go anyway,
even without permission.
Martha, may I have the first package, please?
That’s Hercules,
Never question a gift,
Hercules Busts Heads?
Great show.
Wait a minute,
This is a gift?
One of two,
Go on, pick it up.
It’s a compass!
She’s always touching you,
You’re kidding,
Are those Minotaur-shaped?
How will I know if I really, really need it?
Um, thanks,
But Lord Hermes, why are you helping me?
You don’t mean … Luke?
Look,
You invented the Internet?
It was my idea!
I-I’m not sure.
You will some day.
And you, Percy,
I hope I packed well for you,
I do have some experience with travel.
Ship?
Wait,
I don’t understand any of this. I haven’t even agreed to go!
I’d make up your mind in the next five minutes, if I were you,
What’s going on?
I heard you calling for help!
Me, too!
Heard you yell, ‘Bad things are attacking!’
I didn’t call you guys,
I’m fine.
But then who …
Just listen,
We don’t have much time.
Percy,
we have to do the quest.
We’ll get expelled, you know. Trust me, I’m an expert at getting expelled.
So? If we fail, there won’t be any camp to come back to.
I want to go,
No!
We can’t leave him,
Tantalus will punish him for us being gone.
Percy,
Tyson can go,
if he wants to.
Want to!
All right,
How do we get to that ship?
Hermes said my father would help.
Well then, Seaweed Brain? What are you waiting for?
Urn, Dad?
How’s it going?
Percy!
We’re in a hurry!
We need your help,
Fish ponies!
Hippocampi!
They’re beautiful.
We’ll admire them later,
Come on!
There!
Tyson!
Grab a duffel bag!
Tyson!
Uh?
Come on!
Giddyup!
How do we get aboard?
You first,
Tyson, shhh!
Come on, big guy!
Can’t we take Rainbow?
Rainbow?
Um, we have to go,
Rainbow … well, he can’t climb ladders.
I will miss you, Rainbow!
Maybe we’ll see him again sometime,
Oh, please!
Tomorrow!
It’s a ghost ship,
No,
Bad smell.
I don’t smell anything.
Cyclopes are like satyrs,
They can smell monsters. Isn’t that right, Tyson?
Okay,
So what exactly do you smell?
Something bad,
Great,
That clears it up.
We need a hiding place,
Somewhere safe to sleep.
Sleep,
I’ll be next door,
You guys don’t drink or eat anything.
You think this place is enchanted?
I don’t know. Something isn’t right. Just … be careful.
Honeypie!
What are you doing?
Nothing!
Just weaving my bridal train, as you can see.
It hasn’t gotten any longer!
Oh, um, yes it has, dearest. See? I’ve added at least an inch.
Too many delays!
You smell good! Like goats!
Oh.
Do you like it? It’s Eau de Chevre. I wore it just for you.
Mmmm!
Good enough to eat!
Oh, you’re such a flirt!
No more delays!
But dear, I’m not done!
Tomorrow!
No, no. Ten more days.
Five!
Oh, well, seven then. If you insist.
Seven! That is less than five, right?
Certainly. Oh yes.
Hurry, Percy,
Please, please, please!
What did he say?
The happy man said … bowling practice?
Disemboweling practice?
Yes,
Good morning,
Percy, this is weird,
They’re all in some kind of trance.
Not hungry anymore,
Yesss,
He drawssss them. Ssssoon we will be sssstrong.
We have to get out of here.
You think I want to be in the girls’ restroom?
I mean the ship, Percy! We have to get off the ship.
Smells bad,
-only a matter of time. Don’t push me, Agrius!
I’m not pushing you!
It’ll pay off,
Leave now?
We can’t,
We have to find out what Luke is up to,
Nobody!
Please?
Hide!
You see that Aethiopian drakon in the cargo hold?
Yeah, it’s awesome.
I hear they got two more coming,
That was Chris Rodriguez!
Percy.
Look.
Scythian Dracaenae,
Dragon women.
Come on,
The sooner we find Luke the better.
Voices inside.
You can hear that far?
-the prophecy ourselves. The fools won’t know which way to turn.
Stop that, Tyson! How do you do that? It’s creepy.
Just listening.
Keep going,
What else are they saying?
Quiet!
Are you sure?
Yes,
Right outside.
Run!
Well,
If it isn’t my two favorite cousins. Come right in.
Well,
A little nicer than Cabin Eleven, huh?
Sit,
Where are my manners?
You don’t know Agrius and Oreius’s story?
For lunch,
Hehe! Hehe!
Shut up, you idiot!
Go punish yourself!
You poisoned Thalia’s tree.
Right to the point, eh? Okay, sure I poisoned the tree. So what?
How could you?
I didn’t dishonor her!
Liar!
I understand you want to destroy the camp!
You’re a monster!
Because you have none of your own!
Hey!
Traveling with a Cyclops,
Stop it!
Leave her alone,
And leave Tyson out this.
Oh, yeah, I heard. Your father claimed him.
Spies, you mean.
I know what I need to know,
Like, who my enemies are.
Then you’re a fool.
Percy is not a fool!
Too bad, Cyclops,
Luke,
Listen to me. Your father sent us.
Don’t-even- mention him.
Angry?
So?
He is re-forming,
That’s disgusting!
You’re insane,
Go to Tartarus,
A shame.
Ah, good, security,
I’m afraid we have some stowaways.
Yes, sir,
Hehe! Hehe!
Let me go, too,
Is no threat,
Agrius, stay here. We have important matters to discuss.
Oreius, don’t fail me. Stay in the hold to make sure the drakon is properly fed.
Now.
Ah!
We are not having a blast in the pool!
Stop him!
Lifeboat!
How do you launch this thing?
Get in!
Hold on!
Thermos!
What?
Hang on!
I am hanging on!
Tighter!
Percy,
What?
Curse my relatives!
Yeah, baby!
Woo-hoooooo!
-Miami,
That’s Virginia Beach!
Five hundred and thirty nautical miles,
How did you know that?
I-I’m not sure.
Percy, what’s our position?
36 degrees, 44 minutes north, 76 degrees, 2 minutes west,
Whoa. How did I know that?
Because of your dad,
Other boat is coming.
We can’t let them catch us,
They’ll ask too many questions.
Keep going into Chesapeake Bay,
I know a place we can hide.
There,
Past that sandbar.
Come on,
It’s just down the bank.
What is?
Just follow.
Not a good place,
Here.
A half-blood hideout.
Thalia and I,
And Luke.
So …
You don’t think Luke will look for us here?
Um, Tyson?
Convenience store?
Yeah, for snacks. Powdered donuts or something. Just don’t go too far.
Powdered donuts,
I will look for powdered donuts in the wilderness.
Here, donuts!
It’s not your fault.
He let us go too easily,
The Fleece is the bait? Or Grover?
What did he mean,
that Thalia would’ve been on his side?
He’s wrong.
You don’t sound sure.
Let’s go with ‘best friends.’
No.
Okay, then. Neither would she. Luke’s wrong.
So what did Luke mean about Cyclopes?
I know what he said. He … he was talking about the real reason Thalia died.
Powdered donuts!
Fifty feet,
Monster Donut shop-just over the hill!
This is bad,
This shouldn’t be here,
It’s wrong.
What?
It’s a donut shop.
Shhh!
Why are we whispering? Tyson went in and bought a dozen. Nothing happened to him.
He’s a monster.
A chain,
It could be a nest,
A nest for what?
Haven’t you ever wondered how franchise stores pop up so fast?
Um, no. Never thought about it.
What?
They breed what?
No-sudden-moves,
Very slowly, turn around.
Scatter!
Tyson!
Move!
No!
Percy!
You just opened another Monster Donut shop somewhere!
I’m about to die and you’re worried about that? How do we kill it?
Fire!
We have to have fire!
No hitting my friends!
What’s that noise?
Steam engine,
What?
There! Prepare the thirty-twopounder!
They’re too close, m’lady!
Damn the heroes!
Full steam ahead!
Aye, m’lady.
Fire at will, Captain!
Hit the dirt!
Gross!
Steamship!
Losers,
But I suppose I have to rescue you. Come aboard.
You are in so much trouble,
Tantalus expelled you for eternity,
Did they give you this ship?
‘Course not. My father did.
Ares?
Destroy anyone. I like that.
Clarisse,
Good! I’ll blow him out of the water.
You don’t understand,
No!
Where are your cabin mates?
They didn’t … I let them stay behind. To protect the camp.
You mean even the people in your own cabin wouldn’t help you?
Shut up, Prissy! I don’t need them! Or you!
Clarisse,
No! I don’t care what the Oracle-
What?
What did the Oracle tell you?
Nothing.
So we’re prisoners?
Guests. For now.
Aha!
Dear! I didn’t-you were so quiet!
Unraveling!
So that’s the problem!
Come!
Yes,
Put that on the spinning wheel!
Magic. Cannot be unraveled.
Oh … well …
Poor Honeypie!
Isn’t that … thoughtful of you!
Hehe.
But-but, dear,
what if someone were to rescue-I mean attack this island?
Pets?
And then,
they would have to get through me!
Now, come!
Back to the cave.
All hands on deck! Find Lady Clarisse! Where is that girl?
The entrance to what?
The Sea of Monsters, of course.
I don’t want excuses, little girl!
Y-yes, father,
You don’t want to see me mad, do you?
No, father.
No, father,
You’re pathetic. I should’ve let one of my sons take this quest.
I’ll succeed!
I’ll make you proud.
You’d better,
I DON’T CARE WHAT IT SAID!
You will succeed. And if you don’t …
Do we understand each other?
What’s wrong?
Another dream?
Too much strain on the pistons. Not meant for deep water.
Hurricane?
No,
Charybdis.
Are you crazy?
Only way into the Sea of Monsters. Straight between Charybdis and her sister Scylla.
What do you mean the only way?
The sea is wide open! Just sail around them.
What about the Clashing Rocks?
That’s another gateway. Jason used it.
I can’t blow apart rocks with my cannons,
Monsters, on the other hand …
You are crazy,
Watch and learn, Wise Girl.
Set course for Charybdis!
Aye, m’lady.
Clarisse,
Charybdis sucks up the sea. Isn’t that the story?
And spits it back out again, yeah.
What about Scylla?
Choose Scylla then,
Everybody goes below deck and we chug right past.
No!
You still have your thermos full of wind?
What about controlling the water?
You’re Poseidon’s son. You’ve done it before.
I-I can’t,
We need a backup plan,
This isn’t going to work.
Annabeth is right,
Engine’s no good.
What do you mean?
Pressure. Pistons need fixing.
Full reverse!
Boiler room overheating, ma’am! She’s going to blow!
Well, get down there and fix it!
Can’t!
We’re vaporizing in the heat.
We’re going in too fast,
Prepare yourself for death.
No!
I can fix it.
You?
He’s a Cyclops,
He’s immune to fire. And he knows mechanics.
Go!
Tyson, no!
It’s too dangerous!
Only way, brother.
I will fix it. Be right back.
Lady Clarisse,
Starboard and forward guns are in range!
Fire!
Again!
Tyson did it!
Wait!
We need to stay close!
We’ll die!
We have to move away.
The engine is about to blow!
Where’s Tyson?
Still down there,
We have to abandon ship.
No!
Scylla!
Everyone get below!
We can’t!
Below deck is in flames.
Lifeboats!
Quick!
They’ll never get clear of the cliffs,
We’ll all be eaten.
We have to try. Percy, the thermos.
I can’t leave Tyson!
We have to get the boats ready!
Get the other boat.
I’ll get Tyson.
You can’t!
The heat will kill you!
Tyson!
Rest,
You’re going to need it.
Tyson … ?
Percy, I’m really sorry.
He may have survived,
I mean, fire can’t kill him.
Yeah,
You can never trust a Cyclops.
Annabeth, what’s Chiron’s prophecy?
I know Chiron promised the gods he wouldn’t tell me. But you didn’t promise, did you?
Knowledge isn’t always good for you.
Your mom is the wisdom goddess!
I know! But every time heroes learn the future, they try to change it, and it never works.
The gods are worried about something I’ll do when I get older,
Why?
This kid in the prophecy … he or she couldn’t be like, a Cyclops?
The Oracle said ‘half-blood.’ That always means half-human, halfgod. There’s really nobody alive who it could be, except you.
Then why do the gods even let me live? It would be safer to kill me.
You’re right.
Thanks a lot.
Did the prophecy give any hints?
Land,
There’s land nearby!
Welcome!
Channel Five Fort Lauderdale
Is this your first time with us?
Umm …
First-time-at-spa,
Let’s see …
A what?
Right!
I guess it couldn’t hurt,
You okay?
You look pale.
I’m okay,
Just … let’s keep walking.
It’s beautiful.
You appreciate weaving, my dear?
Oh, yes, ma’am!
Oh, dear,
You do need my help.
Ma’am?
But …
What’s wrong with my hair?
Wasted?
Oh, definitely,
Well …
I suppose …
Right this way, dear,
There, there,
How about we try … this.
What do you see?
Whoa,
Do you want that?
No,
I can give you a full makeover,
What’s the catch?
I have to like … eat a special diet?
Oh, it’s quite easy,
One of these, substituted for a regular meal,
How is that possible?
Why question it? I mean, don’t you want the perfect you right away?
Why are there no guys at this spa?
Oh, but there are,
Now, Percy,
Your judgment.
What have you … what’s happening?
Don’t worry, Percy,
The pain will pass. Look! As I promised. Immediate results.
Reeet, reeet, reeet!
Perfect!
See, Percy? You’ve unlocked your true self!
Reeet, reeet, reeet!
A guinea pig,
Reeet!
None of that, little one,
Meet my discipline problems, Percy,
Miss C.C.?
Where’s Percy?
Your library is amazing!
Yes, indeed,
An architect?
Pah!
You, my dear, have the makings of a sorceress. Like me.
A sorceress?
Yes, my dear.
I-I don’t understand.
Stay with me,
You are too intelligent, my dear,
Bah! Men get all the glory.
You … C.C. … Circe!
Yes, my dear.
You need not worry. I mean you no harm.
What have you done to Percy?
Only helped him realize his true form.
Forget him,
Join me and learn the ways of sorcery.
Let me think about it,
Just… give me a minute alone. To say good-bye.
Of course, my dear,
One minute. Oh … and so you have absolute privacy …
Well,
how fast a minute passes. What is your answer, my dear?
This,
What will Annabeth’s makeover be?
How!
Turn Percy back to a human or else!
I can’t!
Then you asked for it.
No!
No!
You don’t understand! Those are the worst!
Argggh!
What’s the witch done t’me!
No!
I recognize you! Edward Teach, son of Ares?
Aye, lass,
Thanks …
I’m glad you’re not a guinea pig.
Me, too.
Come on, Seaweed Brain,
We have to get away while Circe’s distracted.
Which ship?
There,
I can make it work.
How?
Argggh!
We’ll never get going in time!
Mizzenmast!
One of the forges of Hephaestus,
Where he makes his metal monsters.
Like the bronze bulls?
Go around. Far around.
I guess you deserve to know,
Well, the worst wrong turn was into a Cyclops’s lair in Brooklyn.
They’ve got Cyclopes in Brooklyn?
What did you do?
I stabbed him in the foot.
Yeah, but still … that was pretty brave, Annabeth.
Go below,
You need some rest.
Well, Seaweed Brain?
Well?
Are we going to stop him or not?
Fine. Leave it to me and Aegis.
No,
No.
It can’t be.
No!
Ah!
Percy, you were having a nightmare. You need to get up.
Wh-what is it?
What’s wrong?
Land,
We’re approaching the island of the Sirens.
I want you to do me a favor,
No problem,
I want to hear them.
Why?
Don’t untie me,
Are you trying to tempt me?
Ha-ha.
Stay!
I’ll get us back to the ship,
It’s okay. Just hang on.
You okay?
I didn’t realize,
What?
I saw the way you rebuilt Manhattan,
And Luke and your parents.
You saw that?
That brown stuff they spread on veggie sandwiches?
No, Seaweed Brain. That’s hummus. Hubris is worse.
What could be worse than hummus?
You feel that way?
I’m listening.
Um … no. Me running the world would kind of be a nightmare.
Then you’re lucky. Hubris isn’t your fatal flaw.
What is?
So was it worth it?
Do you feel … wiser?
Percy.
monster island,
The Fleece,
If we take it away, will the island die?
It’ll fade. Go back to what it would be normally, whatever that is.
This is too easy,
We could just hike up there and take it?
There’s supposed be a guardian. A dragon or …
They’re like piranhas,
Percy!
Look.
Sorry,
S’okay,
Ugh,
Ouch,
Garrr!
You’re a feisty one!
Challenge me!
Give me back my sword and I’ll fight you!
Hmm,
Did you say bride?
Who- Grover?
Shut up. She has to shut up.
What ‘Grover’?
The satyr!
Oh!
What satyr?
Satyrs are good eating. You bring me a satyr?
No, you big idiot!
That satyr! Grover! The one in the wedding dress!
I don’t see very well,
Not since many years ago when the other hero stabbed me in eye. But YOU’RE-NO-LADYCYCLOPS!
Stop!
Don’t eat me raw! I-I have a good recipe!
Wait!
Recipe?
Grilled satyr with mango chutney,
You a satyr, too?
No, you overgrown pile of dung!
Rip my arms off,
And stuff them down your throat!
You got spunk.
Let me down!
But … you’re still getting married?
Who’s the bride?
Mangos,
What are mangos?
Trickery,
We can’t beat him by force, so we’ll have to use trickery.
Okay,
I haven’t figured that part out yet.
Great.
Polyphemus will have to move the rock to let the sheep inside.
At sunset,
I could get inside,
invisibly.
What about me?
The sheep,
How much do you like sheep?
Just don’t let go!
Oy! Goaties! Sheepies!
This is it!
I’ll be close by. Don’t worry.
Hasenpfeffer!
Hello, ugly!
Who said that?
Nobody!
Nobody!
I remember you!
You’re too stupid to remember anybody,
Much less Nobody.
Come here! Let me kill you, Nobody!
You can’t kill Nobody, you stupid oaf,
Come find me!
Nobody
It’s no good,
This rope is like iron!
Just a few more minutes!
Grover,
You’ve been working at it for hours!
Percy?
You’re supposed to be blown up!
Perrrrrcy!
You heard me! You came!
Yeah, buddy,
Of course I came.
Where’s Annabeth?
Outside,
But there’s no time to talk. Clarisse, hold still.
Thanks.
You’re welcome,
Now, was anyone else on board your lifeboat?
I got Nobody!
Hah!
I’ll rush him,
No way,
We’ll take him together,
Yeah,
All right,
Attack plan Macedonia.
Hey, Ugly!
Another one? Who are you?
Put down my friend. I’m the one who insulted you.
You are Nobody?
That’s right, you smelly bucket of nose drool!
RAAAR!
For Pan!
Get Annabeth!
Fall back!
Grind you into sheep chow!
A thousand curses on Nobody!
Faster!
Grover!
Get Annabeth’s knife!
Failed!
Nobody failed!
Uhhhhhhhh,
Percy!
Please, noooo!
Kill him!
What are you waiting for?
He’s a Cyclops!
Don’t trust him!
We only want the Fleece,
Will you agree to let us take it?
No!
Kill him!
I’m going to step back slowly,
One false move …
Foolish mortal!
Take my Fleece? Ha! I eat you first.
Bad Polyphemus,
Not all Cyclopes as nice as we look.
You thank the gods she is hurt?
No!
Which one?
In the tree!
The gold one!
Oh. Pretty. Yes.
No time! Throw it!
You’re not… married?
No. My friends talked me out of it.
Annabeth,
just lay still.
Down!
We have to go,
Our ship is…
Tyson,
can you lead the flock as far away as possible?
The sheep want food.
Come, sheepies! Um, people food this way!
Keep the Fleece around you,
Ohh. Not fully healed.
Ribs broken,
They’re mending, but definitely broken.
How can you tell?
Because I’ve broken a few, runt! I’ll have to carry her.
Incoming!
They probably won’t follow us into the water,
With Annabeth like this?
We can do it,
Once we get to the ship, we’re home free.
You’d think he’d run out of rocks,
Swim for it!
You, young Cyclops!
Traitor to your kind!
Don’t listen to him!
Come on.
I am not a traitor.
You serve mortals!
Thieving humans!
Not a traitor,
And you are not my kind.
Death or victory!
Percy!
Come on!
Go,
I will hold Big Ugly.
No! He’ll kill you.
Together,
Destroy you!
Fleece stealer!
You stole the Fleece!
You’ve been using it to lure satyrs to their deaths!
So? Satyrs good eating!
The Fleece should be used to heal! It belongs to the children of the gods!
I am a child of the gods!
Poseidon won’t curse me,
Humans not the same! Nasty, tricky, lying!
Young one!
Where are you? Help me!
You weren’t raised right!
Tyson!
No!
Blaaaaah!
Let him go,
Run.
I will smash you.’
Where are you?
Rarrr!
Yeah, yeah!
Clarisse!
Shut up!
Dive!
I did it! I finally sank Nobody!
Did it,
We …
You’re a genius,
Percy, wake up.
Miami, I think,
But the hippocampi are acting funny.
This is as far as they’ll take us,
June eighteenth! We’ve been away from camp ten days!
That’s impossible!
Thalia’s tree must be almost dead,
We have to get the Fleece back tonight.
How are we supposed to do that?
Percy’s fault?!
Stop it!
Clarisse,
what did the Oracle tell you exactly?
Ouch,
No,
No … wait a minute. I’ve got it.
Cash?
Like … green paper?
Yeah.
Like the kind in duffel bags?
Tyson!
Thought it was a feed bag for Rainbow,
Clarisse,
Come on. You’re going to the airport. Annabeth, give her the Fleece.
It’s your quest,
You can count on me. I won’t fail.
Not failing would be good.
Percy,
Generous?
Insane,
It’s her quest,
She deserves a chance.
Percy is nice,
Percy is too nice,
Come on,
Let’s find another way home.
Hey, cuz,
Welcome back to the States.
Percy,
What do you want, Luke?
Why, Percy,
I want to extend my hospitality, of course.
hospitality.
And so, the Fleece,
Where is it?
Hey!
That’s real goat fur under there!
Sorry, old friend.
Blaa-ha-ha!
Some old friend!
Maybe you didn’t hear me.
Where-is-the-Fleece?
Not here,
We sent it on ahead of us. You messed up.
You’re lying. You couldn’t have …
Clarisse?
You trusted … you gave …
Yeah.
Agrius!
Y-yes?
Get below and prepare my steed. Bring it to the deck. I need to fly to the Miami Airport, fast.’
Do it!
Or I’ll feed you to the drakon!
You’ve been toying with us all along,
Of course, you idiot! And you’ve messed everything up!
Traitor!
You tricked all of us!
Even DIONYSUS at CAMP HALF-BLOOD!
Who poisoned Thalia’s tree, Luke?
I did, of course,
Chiron had nothing to do with it?
Ha! You know he would never do that. The old fool wouldn’t have the guts.
You call it guts? Betraying your friends? Endangering the whole camp?
You were going to heal Kronos,
You know that! Why do you keep asking me?
Because I want everybody in the audience to hear you.
What audience?
Well,
some unplanned dinner entertainment.
Mr. D, you heard him,
I suppose not.
The Iris-message could be a trick,
I fear not,
I got it!
We are no longer in need of your services, Tantalus,
You may return to the Underworld. You are dismissed.
No! But-Nooooooooooo!
Kronos was right, Percy. You’re an unreliable weapon. You need to be replaced.
You’ll never leave this boat alive.
One on one,
What are you afraid of?
Sir!
Your steed is ready!
I told you last summer, Percy,
You can’t bait me into a fight.
And you keep avoiding one,
Scared your warriors will see you get whipped?
I’ll kill you quickly,
Luke,
at least give him a shield.
Sorry, Annabeth,
You bring your own equipment to this party.
My, Percy,
You’re out of practice.
Perrrrrcy!
One thing I want you to watch before you die, Percy.
He-he! He-he!
Brother!
Ponies!
Come get some!
Attack, you fools.’
Withdraw, brethren!
You won’t get away with this, horse man!
Dude, get your big friend!
Tyson!
Come on!
Dude!
Dude!
That was awesome! Head slam!
Chiron,
You saved us.
But how did you know where we were?
Gee, thanks,
No, no,
So what now?
But we got the Fleece!
Clarisse is on her way back to camp with it right now.
You’re coming, too?
Annabeth,
Sure, Chiron,
Come on, goat boy.
But I don’t like paintball.
Yes, you do.
It wasn’t her fault,
I made her tell me.
I suppose I could not expect to keep it secret forever.
So am I the one in the prophecy?
That’s what it meant,
That’s what what meant?
But there isn’t any other half-blood child of the Big Three!
That we know of.
And Kronos is rising. He’s going to destroy Mount Olympus!
He will try,
I’m just a kid, Chiron,
Celestial bronze, Percy. An immortal weapon. What would happen if you shot this at a human?
Nothing,
It would pass right through.
That’s right,
I … I don’t know.
You talk like you know him.
I do know him.
Indeed.
But, Chiron … I mean, come on! Why would they think you’d ever betray the camp for Kronos?
You, uh, owe Kronos a favor or something? He spared your life?
Percy,
The titan Kronos is my father.
really-big-lizardwith-breath-that-blows-stuff-up
What?
Nothing,
Just good to be home.
Hermes?
Hello, Percy. Didn’t recognize me without my jogging clothes?
Uh …
Oh, listen, Lord Hermes, about Luke …
Uh, we saw him, all right,
You weren’t able to talk sense into him?
Well, we kind of tried to kill each other in a duel to the death.
I see. You tried the diplomatic approach.
Do you ever feel your father abandoned you, Percy?
Only a few hundred times a day.
I tried to kill him.
You should get to bed,
A delivery?
I am the messenger of the gods, Percy.
Sign there, please.
Ah!
Oh, uh, sorry.
No …
Uh, we didn’t find any.
Good luck tomorrow,
What do you mean?
Enough, you two,
Good-bye, Percy. For now.
Here,
Thanks, man.
Didn’t finish in time for the trip,
Sorry, sorry.
Hey, man. No big deal.
If you need protection in race,
hit the button.
Ah, okay.
And, hey, um, Tyson …
I wanted to say, well …
I know what you will tell me,
He sent you to help me. Just what I asked for.
You asked Poseidon for … me?
For a friend,
But that’s so cruel!
The scars on your back?
Percy!
Come on!
Tyson …
Go,
You will win!
I-yeah, okay, big guy. We’ll win this one for you.
We’ve got ‘em!
Incoming!
You’re mine!
Yeah, right!
Can’t cut them.’
Switch with me!
Take the reins!
Trust me!
See ya, Percy!
Here’s a little parting gift!
Greek fire!
Get rid of it!
What?
Percy!
Hold up! Listen! It wasn’t just us!
Brother!
Tyson, my baby brother.
YMCA,
But, if I get in trouble again, you’ll be in danger, Percy! You could die!
YMCA
How did you manage that?
You just said that and they bought it?
I manipulated the Mist. Some day, when you’re ready, I’ll show how it’s done.
You mean, I can go back to Meriwether next year?
It’s high time you called her.
Percy-Jackson-what-were-you-thinking-do-you-have-anyidea-how-worried-I-was-sneaking-off-to-camp-without-permission-going-on-dangerous-quests-andscaring-me-half-to-death
Oh, I’m just glad you’re safe!
I’m sorry, Mom,
I won’t scare you again.
Don’t promise me that, Percy. You know very well it will only get worse.
I could come home for a while,
Yeah, of course. Uh, if there’s any school that will take me.
Oh, we’ll find something, dear,
Some place where they don’t know us yet.
Dream came from Daddy last night,
He wants me to visit.
An internship?
Yes.
When would you leave?
Now.
Now. Like … now now?
Now.
I’m happy for you, big guy,
Seriously.
Hard to leave my new brother,
You’ll make the best weapons ever,
Brothers help each other.
You’re my brother,
No doubt about it.
Use the shield well.
I will, big guy.
Save your life some day.
Hey, Percy.
Tyson …
He had to …
We know,
Chiron told us.
Cyclopes forges.
Come on, Seaweed Brain. Time for dinner.
Percy!
Annabeth … on the hill … she …
Is it true?
Curse the titan lord,
What do you mean?
The Fleece,
The Fleece did its work too well.
It healed the tree,
And poison was not the only thing it purged.
It’s true,
I can’t believe …
She needs nectar and ambrosia,
Come on!
I’m Percy,
You’re safe now.
Strangest dream …
It’s okay.
Dying.
No,
You’re okay. What’s your name?
I am Thalia,
Daughter of Zeus.
Just relax.
Destroy it?
Yes.
I thought we should wait,
So we don’t scare him away.
I’m sure orientation will be fine, Percy, It’s only one morning.
Great,
I can get expelled before I start the school year.
It’s not a date!
It’s just Annabeth, Mom. Jeez!
She’s coming all the way from camp to meet you.
Well, yeah.
You’re going to the movies.
Yeah.
Just the two of you.
Mom!
You’d better get inside, dear. I’ll see you tonight.
Percy?
What’s wrong?
N-nothing,
Does the school have a side entrance?
Down the block on the right. Why?
I’ll see you later.
Hi!
Welcome to Goode,
You are so going to love it.
What’s your name, fish?
Fish?
Freshman.
Uh, Percy.
Oh, Percy Jackson,
We’ve been waiting for you.
Percy?
Ow,
Watch it, fish.
There you are!
Welcome to Goode!
Hey, Paul—uh, Mr. Blofis.
Percy, you look like you’ve seen a ghost.
Yeah, uh—
Where’s the orientation?
The gym. That way. But—
Bye.
Percy?
We prepare to excel early!
Rachel Elizabeth Dare,
Look, I wasn’t—I didn’t—What are you doing here?
Same as you, I guess. Orientation.
You live in New York?
What, you thought I lived at the Hoover Dam?
Hi, guys!
My name is Tammi, and this is like, Kelli.
Run,
Now.
Why?
Get over here!
Keep your head down!
Did they follow you?
You mean the cheerleaders?
I don’t think so,
What are they? What did you see?
You…you wouldn’t believe me.
Oh, yeah, I would,
I know you can see through the Mist.
The what?
Tell me,
Like…the Minotaur and the Hydra?
Yeah, just try not to say those names when I’m around, okay?
And the Furies,
And the Sirens, and—
Okay!
All those monsters,
all the Greek gods—they’re real.
I knew it!
You don’t know how hard it’s been,
Wait. Who are you? I mean really?
I’m not a monster.
I’m a half-blood,
I’m half human.
And half what?
There you are, Percy Jackson,
They’re horrible!
What do they really look like?
Oh, forget her.
Percy,
Uhhh?
Percy!
Snap out of it!
Oh, come on,
May I, mistress?
Get back.
Freshmen,
This is our school, halfblood. We feed on whom we choose!
A vampire!
Don’t mention the legs!
It’s rude to make fun!
A vampire, you say?
Mmmm.
I don’t usually kill girls,
No!
Gross!
Monsters do that,
Sorry.
You killed my trainee!
I am senior empousa,
Yeah?
Then you’re overdue!
Such a pretty little blade,
Poor dear.
Excellent! We’re about to have company!
Percy!
Stop it!
Time to greet our visitors!
Percy, don’t!
Oh no, please!
Percy?
What have you done?
You have to get out of here!
Hey, you’re out early!
Watch where you’re going, Seaweed Brain.
Percy, wait up!
What did you do this time? And who is this?
Hi,
Percy,
We should go.
I want to know more about half-bloods,
But—
I’ll make up some story,
Hey!
There were these two empousai,
You told a mortal girl about half-bloods?
She can see through the Mist. She saw the monsters before I did.
So you told her the truth?
She recognized me from Hoover Dam, so—
You’ve met her before?
Um, last winter. But seriously, I barely know her.
She’s kind of cute.
I—I never thought about it.
I’ll deal with the school,
Honest, it’ll be fine.
You’re right,
Any word on Luke?
problem.
Mount Tam is still overrun with monsters,
What about Grover?
He’s at camp,
We’ll see him today.
Did he have any luck? I mean, with the search for Pan?
You’ll see,
Yes, please,
Hey, Peleus,
Keeping everything safe?
I need to talk to Clarisse,
What for?
We’ve been working on something,
I’ll see you later.
Working on what?
I’ll tell Chiron you’re here,
What hearing?
Yeah,
Great talking with you, too.
Yaaaaah!
WOOF!
Whoa there!
Truce!
WOOF!
That’s a hellhound!
She’s harmless,
That’s Mrs. O’Leary.
Mrs. O’Leary?
Good girl,
Mrs. O’Leary is my pet,
Who are you?
I guess.
Quintus.
Percy Jackson,
Sorry about—How did you, um—
Oh.
Whoa, girl!
Those aren’t for you.
What’s in the boxes?
A little surprise,
Uh, okay,
You—you’re a half-blood?
You know about my prophecy?
I’ve heard a few things.
Percy, there you are!
I see you’ve met our new instructor.
Quintus, do you mind if I borrow Percy?
Not at all, Master Chiron.
No need to call me ‘Master’,
Come, Percy. We have much to discuss.
Well, see you,
Mysterious?
Hard to read?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mm,
What were they doing there?
Waiting for me?
Possibly,
I would’ve been,
Except for Rachel.
Where?
At his formal hearing,
Punk,
No, no,
He’ll be fine, Juniper.
Master Underwood!
B-but Silenus,
It’s the truth!
But I did!
Impudence!
Now, Maron,
Patience.
Patience, indeed!
Wrong fight, girlie,
Wait.
For six months,
I just need more time,
Nothing!
You have found nothing.
But, Leneus—
Master Underwood,
Thank you!
One more week.
What? But sir! That’s impossible!
But sir, I—I can’t lose my searcher’s license. My whole life—
This meeting of the council is adjourned,
Hi, Percy,
That went well, huh?
Those old goats!
There is another option,
No. No.
Grover, I won’t let you.
What are you talking about?
pretty.
male god
Percy!
Hey, big guy!
Ow, watch the ribs. The ribs.
You are okay?
Not eaten by monsters?
Not even a little bit.
Yay!
But first,
we’ve gotta worry about inspection. We should…
Tyson, the cabin looks…amazing!
See the fish ponies? I put them on the ceiling!
You fixed it!
Oh, my.
Well, I had my doubts. But you clean up nicely, Percy. I’ll remember that.
Lots of bad people above the sea, too,
What’s this ‘other way’?
Goat boy scares me,
Why would you be scared of Grover?
Hooves and horns,
Good try,
But your guard is too low.
Have you always been a swordsman?
I’ve been many things.
What’s that on your neck?
A reminder.
little doggie.
Big crack,
No,
Not an earthquake.
Nico di Angelo,
So he put a crack in the floor?
These skeletons attacked us,
Nico is a son of Hades.
The god of dead people.
Yeah.
So the Nico boy is gone now?
The bad prophecy,
Titans might use him if they knew.
Exactly,
So—
Mouth sealed,
Like the crack in the ground.
O, Iris, Goddess of the rainbow,
Useless,
I can’t believe I ever liked this stuff.
A childish game, master,
I’ve failed,
There’s no way to get her back.
Is there? Speak.
It has never been done,
But there may be a way.
Tell me,
An exchange,
A soul for a soul.
I’ve offered!
Not yours,
Not that again. You’re talking about murder.
I’m talking about justice,
Vengeance.
Those are not the same thing.
You will learn differently as you get older.
I will help you,
Very well. You have a plan?
Oh, yes,
It’s still out there,
You did well, Lee,
Aye,
We’ll see how you all do with that tonight.
Yes…
To the gods.
Poseidon,
I will go…um…polish my fish ponies.
Uh, fine.
I brought Grover over,
What’s he talking about?
I’ll tell you what it’s about,
The Labyrinth.
You’re not supposed to be here,
We need to talk,
But the rules…
Look,
Exactly,
So…it’s not under the king’s palace in Crete anymore,
No.
If you don’t get lost,
And die a horrible death.
Grover, there has to be a way,
Clarisse lived.
Barely!
And the other guy—
He was driven insane. He didn’t die.
Oh, joy.
Whoa,
Back up. What’s this about Clarisse and a crazy guy?
Last year,
I remember,
It was secret.
It was secret,
because she found Chris Rodriguez.
The guy from the Hermes cabin?
Yeah,
What do you mean he just appeared?
String,
Okay,
Why were they exploring the Labyrinth?
We weren’t sure,
Except it’s a maze, right?
Full of horrible traps,
But not if you had Ariadne’s string,
So Luke is trying to find Ariadne’s string,
You think Pan is underground?
It would explain why he’s been impossible to find.
But,
It could lead you to the wild god,
I can’t do it.
Grover, it may be your last chance,
We’ll talk later,
Don’t say that! We’ll figure something out.
I have to leave,
You know those aren’t good for you, Blackjack.
You may be right, Blackjack. We’ll see.
Right,
Gather ’round.
You will be in teams of two,
AWWWWW!
I will now announce your partners,
Aroooof!
Nice.
Your armor is crooked
Grover Underwood,
with Tyson.
What? B-but—
No, no,
Must be a mistake. Goat boy—
No complaining!
They’ll be fine,
This is where we stopped looking.
I saw him last night,
What do you mean?
He’s summoning the dead? That’s not good.
The ghost was giving him bad advice,
He’s going to come after me,
The spirit mentioned a maze.
That settles it. We have to figure out the Labyrinth.
Maybe,
That’s not the Stoll brothers,
Over there,
No, wait,
Behind us.
Hi.
Put those down!
Dryads don’t like sharp blades, okay?
Juniper,
What are you doing here?
I live here.
In the boulders?
In the juniper. Duh.
Are you guys busy?
Well,
We’re not busy,
What’s wrong, Juniper?
No,
I’m sure that’s not it.
He had a crush on a blueberry bush once,
Juniper,
He can’t go underground!
You can’t let him.
Ah.
About that…
Hide!
One of us gets behind it,
Cuts off its tail while the other distracts it in front.
I’ll take point,
You’ve got the invisibility hat.
Three?
Climb?
No time,
Look out!
In here,
I’ll cover you. Go!
Wh-where are we?
Safe from the scorpions, anyway,
It’s a long room,
It’s not a room. It’s a corridor.
Don’t take another step,
We need to find the exit.
It’s okay,
It’s right—
Two steps back,
Okay,
Help me examine the walls.
What for?
The mark of Daedalus,
Uh, okay. What kind of—
Got it!
Percy! Annabeth!
Where have you two been?
We’ve been looking forever.
But we were gone only a few minutes,
Percy!
You are okay?
We’re fine,
We fell in a hole.
Honest!
You’ve been missing for almost an hour,
Yeah,
We would’ve won, but a Cyclops sat on me.
Was an accident!
A hole?
Chiron…maybe we should talk about this at the Big House.
You found it, didn’t you?
I—Yeah. Yeah, we did.
This explains a lot,
It explains what Luke is after.
Wait a second,
What do you mean? What did we find?
Father!
What did they do to you?
I’ll kill you!
There will be no killing today,
You did that yourself, Your Majesty,
Stop!
You love your maze so much,
I don’t fear you,
What shall we do?
Father, they will kill you!
Take heart, my son.
I—I will find a way.
Luke must have known about the Labyrinth entrance,
He knew everything about camp.
She has good taste,
I wouldn’t have paid any attention except…well, it was Luke.
Forget what I said about good taste.
Interesting,
Definitely,
He’s been sending scouts into the maze,
Chris Rodriguez,
Ah,
The one in the…Yes, I understand.
The one in the what?
The guy who created the maze.
Yes,
We need to go in,
Wait a second,
Great idea!
I’ll get the dynamite!
It’s not so easy, stupid,
We could fight,
We will certainly set up defenses,
We have to get to Daedalus’s workshop first,
But if nobody can navigate in there,
what chance do we have?
I’ve been studying architecture for years,
From reading about it.
Well, yes.
That’s not enough.
It has to be!
It isn’t!
Are you going to help me or not?
We all know who should lead this,
Annabeth.
You’ve done as much as I have, Clarisse,
I’m not going back in there.
Don’t tell me you’re scared. Clarisse, chicken?
I didn’t mean to—
Very well,
Percy,
What do you mean?
Who?
The sword master,
He was poking around the rocks.
Quintus? When?
What was he doing? Did he go in?
Juniper?
Where’d you go?
It’s okay,
Try a little more nectar.
You’re an illusion, Mary!
My name’s not Mary.
It’s dark!
So dark!
Come outside,
The sunlight will help you.
A…a thousand skulls. The earth keeps healing him.
Chris,
The son of Poseidon! He’s horrible!
My dear,
You made it.
The dead, the traitor, and the lost one raise.
The lost one! That must mean Pan! That’s great!
With the dead and the traitor,
Not so great.
And?
What is the rest?
You shall rise or fall by the ghost king’s hand,
Hey…we shouldn’t jump to conclusions,
But who’s this ghost king?
Are there more lines?
I don’t remember exactly.
And?
Will you come?
I’m in.
Grover, you too? The wild god is waiting.
lost one
And Tyson,
I’ll need you too.
Yay! Blow-things-up time!
Wait, Annabeth,
I need them all,
Chiron, it’s important.
Annabeth.
I know. But we have to. Please.
I have a bad feeling about this,
I don’t like the idea of you going down there,
You’ve been in there?
Long ago.
A whistle?
A dog whistle,
For Mrs. O’Leary.
Um, thanks, but—
What ice?
Thanks,
Hello?
Knock, knock?
Oh…hi. Didn’t hear you.
You okay?
We’ll figure it out,
I’ve wanted to lead a quest since I was seven,
You’re going to do awesome.
Hey, we’re your friends. We wouldn’t miss it.
But…
What is it?
The prophecy?
I’m sure it’s fine,
What was the last line?
Hey, it’s…it’s okay.
Chiron might be right,
Then don’t worry about it,
This is different. I don’t want anything happening to…any of you.
Um, sorry,
We were just looking at maps,
Okay.
Tell Chiron I’ll be right there,
Annabeth?
You’re wondering which hero? I don’t know.
Our spies report success, my lord,
But the form, my lord…
Yes, my lord. It’s just—
Yes.
Come in.
Hello, Luke,
What is it, demon?
That was before I saw what you did to that boy in Seattle.
Oh, he meant nothing to me,
Thanks, but no thanks. Now report or get out.
What is it?
A presence,
You’re trying to tell me something,
All right,
Show me Nico di Angelo.
Is it deep enough yet?
Nearly, my lord.
I want a second opinion!
You are dismissed,
Thank you.
You might as well thank the shovels,
Let the dead taste again,
In my day, we used animal blood,
I will treat them with respect,
At least let me keep the toy,
Be quiet!
There are too many,
I’ve got it under control,
One at a time,
Who are you?
Speak.
I am Theseus.
How can I retrieve my sister?
Do not try. It is madness.
Just tell me!
My stepfather died,
My lord, the soul exchange! Ask him about that!
That voice. I know that voice.
No you don’t, fool!
I know you,
I want to hear about my sister,
We don’t need any of that,
A soul for a soul,
Is it true?
I—I must say yes. But the specter—
Just answer the questions, knave!
I want to see my sister!
Where is she?
He is coming,
Who?
He comes to find the source of this power,
Stop,
Stop it!
Percy, you look terrible.
He killed the water fountain last night,
What?
Of course, my boy.
Be right back, guys.
Last night,
I dreamed about Luke and Kronos.
I feared this,
Do you know what he meant about a bargain?
Not anyone,
What else would he want?
Indeed,
We’ve got to get to Daedalus first,
and convince him not to.
I don’t know,
That does not surprise me.
It doesn’t sur—you mean you know?
Then why did you let him in?
Percy, you ready?
Take care,
And good hunting.
You too,
Well,
good-bye sunshine.
Hello rocks,
If we keep one hand on the left wall and follow it,
Um, which way did we come in?
Just turn around,
Left walls are mean,
Which way now?
That way,
How do you know?
Deductive reasoning.
So…you’re guessing.
Just come on,
Are we there yet?
We’ve been down here maybe five minutes,
It’s been longer than that,
Whoa.
What is this place?
It looks—
Roman,
But how can they be Roman?
The Labyrinth is a patchwork,
You make it sound like it’s alive.
Let’s not talk about it being alive,
Please?
All right,
Forward.
Down the hall with the bad sounds?
Yeah,
I’m thinking this is not Roman,
A milkman,
What?
They used to deliver milk.
Some people wander in by mistake,
He’s been down here a long time.
Only bones,
Don’t worry, goat boy. The milkman is dead.
The milkman doesn’t bother me,
Oh, good,
I thought maybe I was wrong.
We have to get deeper into the maze,
Well, Annabeth?
Hurry up!
Don’t mind him,
Uh…I don’t…
That funny man has two faces.
The funny man has ears, you know!
No, no,
This way, miss. Talk to me, please.
The exits are closed,
Duh!
Where do they lead?
One probably leads the way you wish to go,
The other leads to certain death.
I—I know who you are,
Oh, you’re a smart one!
Why are you trying to confuse me?
I—
We know you, Annabeth,
No…I don’t—
Leave her alone,
Who are you, anyway?
I’m your best friend,
I’m your worst enemy,
I’m Janus,
I’ll see you soon enough, Perseus Jackson,
Such fun!
Shut up!
Don’t do it,
I’m afraid she has to,
I—I chose—
Janus,
are we causing trouble again?
N-no, milady!
Yes!
Shut up!
Excuse me?
Not you, milady! I was talking to myself.
I see,
What kind of door?
Shut up!
Because French doors are nice,
Shut up!
Causing indecision,
Now be gone!
Party power,
You must be hungry,
Sit with me and talk.
Who…who are you?
I am Hera.
Queen of Heaven.
Grover, dear,
use your napkin. Don’t eat it.
Yes, ma’am,
Yes, nice lady.
Queen Hera,
I came to see you, naturally,
I didn’t think—
Didn’t you try to kill him, like, a lot of times?
You mean when he sired Thalia?
Percy Jackson, isn’t it? One of Poseidon’s…children.
Trying to,
Your father?
Oh, right.
We must watch the minor gods,
That’s where Dionysus went,
Indeed.
What are your goals?
A wish?
But how do we get there?
I don’t understand.
The means is already within your grasp.
I do?
But that’s not fair,
You’re not telling me what it is!
Poof,
Well,
But I don’t,
I don’t know what she was talking about.
All right. Then we’ll just keep going.
Which way?
Left,
How can you be sure?
Because something is coming from the right,
Something big,
In a hurry.
Left is sounding pretty good,
Tyson,
can you—
Yes!
Hurry!
Don’t bring the roof down, but hurry!
Close the entrance!
We trapped it,
Or trapped ourselves,
What in Hades?
A prison,
Maybe Tyson can break—
Shh,
Listen.
what’s that language?
Can’t be.
What?
Wait!
I know this place,
This is Alcatraz.
You mean that island is near San Francisco?
My school took a field trip here. It’s like a museum.
Freeze,
Stop, Tyson!
Can’t you see it?
It’s her,
Get down!
What’s she saying?
What’s that language?
The tongue of the old times.
You understand it?
Can you translate?
You will work for the master or suffer.
I hate it when he does that.
I will not serve,
H-h-horrible,
Cyclopes’ worst nightmare,
Kampê.
Who?
The Heka-what?
The Hundred-Handed Ones,
Very powerful,
Cool,
Unless you’re a mountain.
Kampê was the jailer,
And now Kampê is back,
Bad,
So who’s in that cell?
You said a name—
Briares!
Yeah,
They break mountains.
I guess we should check it out,
Either the sky isn’t as tall as it used to be,
or he’s short.
Briares!
Great Hundred-Handed One!
Help us!
Run while you can, Cyclops,
You are a Hundred-Handed One!
I cannot,
Put on your brave face!
No good,
My scared face keeps coming back.
How did you do that?
Must make it hard to get a yearbook picture,
Do you have one hundred pens?
Guys,
Break the bars,
Yes!
If he’s so strong,
why is he stuck in jail?
He’s terrified,
Briares?
Tyson,
I think you’d better break the bars.
I will break the bars,
Come on, Briares,
Let’s get you out of here.
I cannot,
She will punish me.
It’s all right,
I remember the war.
Don’t listen to her,
Come on!
One game of rock, paper, scissors,
I always win rock, paper, scissors.
Then let’s do it!
I told you,
I always—
What is that you made?
A gun,
That’s not fair.
Demigods are cheaters.
The other way,
Left,
I remember this from the tour.
It’s even worse,
Keep moving,
She is behind us!
Kampê’s too big to get through the doors,
Poison!
Don’t let those things touch you or…
Or we’ll die?
Well…after you shrivel slowly to dust, yes.
Let’s avoid the swords,
Briares, fight!
Grow to full size!
Run.
The boat?
Too slow,
Back into the maze. Only chance.
We need a diversion,
I’ll help you,
No,
Are you sure?
Go, brother. I will meet you inside.
Can’t make it,
Tyson is risking his life to help you!
You will make it.
Hurry!
Look for the mark!
There!
You can do it!
This pit goes straight to Tartarus,
Don’t talk that way,
I have nothing to offer,
I have lost everything.
What about your brothers?
They are no more. They faded.
What exactly do you mean, they faded?
Percy,
I must go,
Kronos’s army will invade camp,
We need help.
I cannot, Cyclops.
You are strong.
Not anymore.
Hey,
Maybe that’s why monsters fade,
It’s okay,
It’s not okay, goat boy. He was my hero.
We must be close to Daedalus’s workshop,
How do we know when it’s morning?
Just rest,
I’m sorry I lost the shield,
You worked so hard to repair it.
He was just scared,
I’m sure he’ll get over it.
He is not strong,
He is not important anymore.
You should sleep,
Can’t. You doing all right?
Sure. First day leading the quest. Just great.
We’ll get there,
We’ll find the workshop before Luke does.
I just wish the quest was logical,
Space isn’t the same in the maze.
I know, I know. It’s just…
You made a cute guinea pig.
And Waterland, how you got us thrown off that ride?
I got us thrown off? That was totally your fault!
See? It’ll be fine.
I don’t know,
Honestly.
You’d tell me if you did?
Sure. Maybe…
Maybe what?
Maybe if you told me the last line of the prophecy, it would help.
Not here. Not in the dark.
What about the choice Janus mentioned? Hera said—
Stop,
Nico is down here somewhere,
How about I take first watch?
Done,
It’s done.
Father, you’re a genius!
You first,
The wax compound should hold for several hours,
And the sun’s heat would loosen them,
One cannot be too careful.
Too slow,
I am too slow.
Take your time, Father,
The guards aren’t due until—
Hurry!
We must have more time,
It’ll be fine,
Well, well,
Going somewhere?
We’re leaving, Minos,
You look like metal chickens,
Perhaps we should pluck you and make a soup.
Metal chickens,
Soup.
Shut up,
The vent!
Get them!
Shoot them!
Free, Father! You did it.
Wait!
Be careful!
Stop that!
Icarus!
Father!
This isn’t right,
It should still be stone.
It smells like the Underworld in here.
Nico,
He was summoning the dead again.
Ghosts were here. I don’t like ghosts.
We’ve got to find him.
Percy!
Where are we?
It’s a cattle guard,
A what?
How do you know that?
All right. But how do we get out?
Sorry, cow!
Red cattle,
The cattle of the sun.
What?
They’re sacred to Apollo.
Holy cows?
Exactly. But what are they doing—
Wait,
Listen.
Bad Janus dog!
Arf!
Heel, Orthus,
What’ve we got here?
Cattle rustlers?
Just travelers,
We’re on a quest.
Half-bloods, eh?
How did you know—
Cyclops,
Yes, I can see that.
The other one?
You mean Nico di Angelo?
We get a load of visitors from the Labyrinth,
Wow,
I feel welcome.
We’re not leaving,
What are they for?
Like who?
No more questions.
It looks like a Frank Lloyd Wright!
Don’t break the rules,
Why?
What does he look like?
Say Hello to Mr. Geryon.
Hi,
Nice chests—uh, ranch! Nice ranch you have.
Geryon, I won’t wait for—
But that’s—
Percy Jackson,
Monster friends?
That man is wearing three shirts,
They let my sister die!
Nico, we’re not here to kill you.
Don’t speak her name! You’re not worthy to even talk about her!
Wait a minute,
I believe you,
We have a huge operation!
Horses and cattle mostly, but all sorts of exotic varieties, too.
Rooster ponies,
Do they lay eggs?
Once a year!
That’s horrible!
They must be an endangered species!
That’s not right,
Now, over here,
What war?
So many,
Yes, well, Apollo is too busy to see them,
For what?
Meat, of course! Armies have to eat.
You kill the sacred cows of the sun god for hamburger meat?
That’s the against ancient laws!
Oh, don’t get so worked up, satyr. They’re just animals.
Just animals!
Yes, and if Apollo cared, I’m sure he would tell us.
If he knew,
Triple G Ranch,
Quintus…
Short gray hair, muscular, swordsman?
Yeah.
Never heard of him,
What is that?
My stables!
They’re disgusting!
Lots of poop,
How can you keep animals like that?
Y’all getting’ on my nerves,
Plus, you’re too cheap to have them cleaned,
Quiet!
What clients?
You’re a monster,
You have to let these animals go,
It’s not right!
And the clients you keep talking about,
I came here for business, Geryon,
Mmm.
Yes, you’ll get a deal, all right.
Wait a second,
I thought I was the soul you wanted.
Oh, I imagine I could,
Minos?
It’s none of your business, Percy!
No.
I would stay in the car, all of you,
Do I have to?
Yes, you fool!
Pick up the sword, too,
Now,
You fiend!
Paid by whom?
What do you mean?
Never you mind, darlin’. Let’s be off, shall we?
Wait!
What sort of deal? Do you have gold?
I’ve got something better. Barter.
But Mr. Jackson, you’ve got nothing.
You could have him clean the stables,
I’ll do it!
Assuming the horses don’t eat you,
Either way, you get my friends,
No!
So what have you got to lose?
Deal.
I hope you know what you’re doing,
I hope so, too.
Sunset,
No later.
Oh no you don’t,
Are you a naiad?
Of course!
But you speak English. And you’re out of the water.
What, you don’t think we can act human if we want to?
Look,
I just came to ask—
I know who you are,
But—
My friends are in danger,
Okay, you win.
Really?
I’m not going to fight you. It’s your river.
Oh. Oh, good. I mean—good thing for you!
I’ll tell you a secret, son of the sea god. Scoop up some dirt.
What?
You heard me.
Those are shells,
Okay,
What good does that do me?
I hope you find a way to rescue your friends.
No way,
Get bigger,
More!
Stop,
Stop!
On one condition,
Let them go!
Let my friends go,
We had a deal.
You promised!
Eurytion,
the boy is starting to annoy me. Kill him.
Kill him yourself,
Excuse me?
You heard me,
And who’d take care of your cattle? Orthus, heel.
Fine!
I’ll deal with you later, after the boy is dead!
Aghhh!
Nice try, sonny,
Coward!
Come back and die right!
You fool! One arrow is no better than one sword.
Thanks, guys,
I owe you one.
Yay for Percy!
Can we tie up this cowherd now?
Yeah!
And that dog almost killed me!
How long will it take Geryon to re-form?
You said you’d died for him before,
How?
Maybe you can change things,
How?
That’d be all right.
Now, that I could live with.
You won’t try to stop us leaving?
Shoot, no.
Your boss said somebody paid for our safe passage. Who?
Maybe he was just saying that to fool you.
What about the Titans?
You could stay here until we’re done with our quest,
Safe?
Nico,
I’m not on anyone’s side. And I’m not afraid.
You should be,
Your sister wouldn’t want—
If you cared for my sister, you’d help me bring her back!
A soul for a soul?
Yes!
But if you didn’t want my soul—
I’m not explaining anything to you!
And I will bring her back.
Bianca wouldn’t want to be brought back,
Not like that.
You didn’t know her!
I’ve tried,
She won’t answer.
Try again. I’ve got a feeling she’ll answer with me here.
Why would she?
Because she’s been sending me Iris-messages,
She’s been trying to warn me what you’re up to, so I can protect you.
That’s impossible.
One way to find out. You said you’re not afraid.
We’re going to need a pit, like a grave. And food and drinks.
Percy,
I don’t think this is a good—
All right,
I’ll try.
Minos should be here by now,
It’s full dark.
Maybe he got lost,
Make him stop,
Stop him!
Minos!
What are you doing?
My apologies, master,
The sacrifice smelled so good, I couldn’t resist.
It is good to see myself again. Almost in solid form—
You are disrupting the ritual!
Get—
Yes, quite right, master,
We’re looking for Bianca di Angelo,
Get lost.
Daedalus cares nothing for you, half-bloods,
The guilt of murder?
Who did he kill?
Do not changed the subject!
Enough, Mions,
The others?
The maze is my property,
Be gone, Minos!
I want to see my sister!
Bianca, appear!
Any time now,
Hello, Percy,
Bianca,
I’m so sorry,
Bianca!
Hello, Nico. You’ve gotten so tall.
Why didn’t you answer me sooner?
I was hoping you would give up.
Give up?
You can’t, Nico. Don’t do this. Percy is right.
No! He let you die! He’s not your friend.
You must listen to me,
I can’t. Never.
So it was you,
You sent those Iris-messages.
Why are you helping him and not me?
It’s not fair!
You are close to the truth now,
No.
She’s right,
I don’t care about Kronos,
I just want my sister back.
You can’t have that, Nico,
I’m the son of Hades! I can.
Don’t try,
If you love me, don’t…
Tartarus stirs,
Wait,
Please—
Good-bye, Nico,
I love you. Remember what I said.
Issss it time, my lord?
Soon,
Continue your work.
My lord,
You have a visitor,
You.
You’re a jailor,
Your job—
We should have left that one in Tartarus,
You should not fear power, Luke. Use it!
The sooner we leave, the better,
I want this over with.
Aww,
I didn’t say that.
You’re not having second thoughts about your own, ah, special part?
I know my duty.
That is good,
We have more than enough,
Mmm,
Oh, yes.
Uncle!
Hello, Perdix,
Yes, Uncle. They were easy!
Oh, yes! Look!
I see. Not bad.
The king loved it!
Did he now?
Yes,
So when I die, you can take my place, eh?
But why?
No, my boy,
I don’t think so,
With the use of a little magic—
Magic? Bah!
Can I fix that astrolabe, then, Uncle? Are your joints swelling up again?
Smarter than me,
Take my place,
I would like to fly,
Perdix,
Catch.
Uncle!
Help me!
Go on, Perdix,
Uncle!
Percy?
Are you okay?
What—what time is it?
Two in the morning,
I miss Juniper.
What?
That can’t be right.
Time is faster in the Labyrinth,
Oh,
Right.
I’m out of time,
We’ll talk to them,
Make them give you more time.
Hey,
Don’t say that. You’re just as much a hero—
No I’m not. I keep trying, but…
We’ll figure out something,
Champion goat boy,
Nico, you could come with us,
I need time to think.
Nico,
Bianca just wants you to be okay.
I’m worried about him,
He’ll be al right,
What about you?
Well, good luck.
Yep.
Can you help us?
That’s what Hera said,
Hephaestus comes here from time to time,
And you’re giving it to me?
Spider!
She’s, um, a little scared of spiders,
Oh.
Sorry, miss.
Hurry,
That thing’s not going to wait for us.
Monkey bars,
I’m great at these.
Sphinx.
Welcome, lucky contestants!
Fabulous prizes!
I’ve got this,
Sorry,
Welcome, Annabeth Chase!
Are you ready for your test?
Yes,
Ask your riddle.
Twenty riddles, actually!
What? But back in the old days—
Okay,
I’m ready.
What…is the capital of Bulgaria?
Sofia,
but—
Correct!
What?
Make sure you bubble each answer clearly and stay inside the circle,
What machine?
Now,
next question—
Wait a second,
I beg your pardon?
Exactly why we changed the test!
Four,
but—
Correct! Which U.S. president signed the Emancipation Proclamation?
Abraham Lincoln, but—
Correct! Riddle number four. How much—
Hold up!
These aren’t riddles,
What do you mean?
It’s just a bunch of dumb, random facts,
Think?
Stop!
This is a stupid test.
Um, Annabeth,
I’m a child of Athena,
Why then, my dear,
No!
Turn invisible,
I can fight!
No!
The Sphinx is after you! Let us get it.
No fair!
Cheater!
My grading machine!
Annabeth!
Here!
Keep moving!
Ready to meet Hephaestus?
No,
Yes!
Well, well,
There,
Much better.
I didn’t make you, did I?
Uh,
no, sir.
Good,
Shoddy workmanship.
Half-bloods,
We’ve met, sir,
Have we?
Satyr.
Uh…
Yes, well said,
Sir,
Daedalus?
Uh, yes, sir, please,
Humph. You’re wasting your time.
Y-yes, lord. We met a Hundred-Handed One.
Briares?
Yes. He—he was scared. He would not help us.
And that bothered you.
Yes!
But I thought Zeus did that to you,
Mother likes telling that version of the story,
Believe me, young Cyclops,
Oh, this one doesn’t like me,
We told you,
Why not?
You know where he is, then,
It isn’t wise to go looking, girl.
My mother says looking is the nature of wisdom.
Who’s your mother, then?
Athena.
Figures.
Name it,
You heroes,
One of my forges,
That’s Mount St. Helens,
Great forests around there.
You’ve been there?
Looking for…you know, Pan.
Wait,
What do you want us to do?
Fight him?
You want us to find out who it is,
Aye,
Glad you noticed,
Go and find out what you can,
All right,
How do we get there?
My creation will show you the way,
What is it?
Come on!
We have to keep moving.
This is the way,
This is it.
What way?
You mean…to Pan?
Don’t you smell it?
Dirt,
And plants.
Yes! This is the way. I’m sure of it!
Well come back,
The tunnel will be gone by then,
But we can’t,
The forges!
I have to, Annabeth. Don’t you understand?
We’ll split up,
No!
I—I will go with him.
Tyson, are you sure?
I hope you’re right,
I know I am.
Be careful,
This is bad,
Splitting up is a really, really bad idea.
We’ll see them again,
Hey, wait up,
Yeah?
Something Hephaestus said back there…about Athena.
She swore never to marry,
But then—
How come she has demigod children?
Percy, you know how Athena was born?
She sprung from the head of Zeus in full battle armor or something.
So your dad and Athena…so you weren’t…
I was a brain child,
But—
Um…no. That’s okay.
I thought not.
Hold it!
Bring it in?
Yeah,
Movie’s just about done.
Oi,
Thing weighs a ton.
It’s celestial bronze,
What did you expect?
Just set it in the back,
Now, younglings,
Sea demons!
No. Anyone else?
Telekhines!
Very good,
And why are we here?
Revenge!
Yes, yes, but why?
Zeus is evil!
Indeed,
And so, younglings,
who do we serve?
Kronos!
Yes!
A demigod!
Eat it!
Back off!
New lesson, class,
CLASS DISMISSED!
Annabeth!
Shhh!
You want to get us killed?
Percy, what is your problem?
We’re going to have company!
So that’s what they are,
The blade is almost complete,
Aye,
It shall be even sharper than before.
What is that?
They were talking about the greatest Titan weapon,
The telekhines betrayed the gods,
With Kronos.
We have to get out—
Put your cap back on,
Get out!
What?
No! I’m not leaving you.
But you’ll be killed!
I’ll be fine. Besides, we’ve got no choice.
Be careful, Seaweed Brain.
There!
What do we have here? A son of Poseidon?
Yes,
I can smell the sea in his blood.
Strike down one of us, demigod,
Your father’s nature protects you,
Stay still,
You’re too weak to rise.
Who?
Shhh, brave one,
Holy Poseidon,
Well,
the sleeper finally wakes.
Who were you talking to?
Oh…just a messenger,
How do you feel?
How long have I been out?
Time,
You know my name?
You talk in your sleep.
Yeah. I’ve been…uh, told that before.
Yes. Who is Annabeth?
I’m sorry,
Is that near Mount St. Helens?
It isn’t near anything, brave one,
But my friends—
Annabeth,
And Grover and Tyson?
Yes!
Why would you think that?
Or anything else?
I am no evil sorceress,
Rest,
Percy, what do you see?
I was just looking at…
That’s moonlace,
It can only be planted at night.
What does it do?
Do?
I suppose not,
It’s awesome,
Back home,
my mom always wanted a garden.
Why did she not plant one?
Well, we live in Manhattan. In an apartment.
Manhattan? Apartment?
You don’t know what I’m talking about, do you?
I fear not. I haven’t left Ogygia in…a long time.
Well, Manhattan’s a big city, with not much gardening space.
Why haven’t you left your island?
It is my punishment.
Why? What did you do?
I? Nothing. But I’m afraid my father did a great deal. His name is Atlas.
Still,
What is it?
What? I asked. “I don’t know.
You want me to go?
I…
I’ll see you in the morning. Sleep well.
There it is again,
What?
You keep pulling away, like you’re trying not to enjoy yourself.
How? Tell me. I want to help.
Don’t say that. Please don’t say that.
Tell me what the punishment is.
Because your father was Atlas.
But that’s not fair,
But, Percy,
What? But the Titans are evil!
Are they? All of them? All the time?
Perhaps I was wrong in the war,
You don’t have any friends?
What is that?
A visitor.
Lord Hephaestus,
This is a rare honor.
Stupid servants,
Hephaestus,
what’s going on? Is Annabeth—
She’s fine,
You haven’t told her I’m okay?
That’s not for me to say,
What do you mean?
Of course I’m coming back!
Still uncertain about further eruptions,
You caused quite an explosion.
The telekhines were scattered,
I couldn’t release him, could I? I mean, I’m not that powerful!
What about Grover and Tyson?
So what am I supposed to do?
Aphrodite.
Is this part of her plan?
Did she land me here?
Yeah,
Yeah, I know.
Then you’ll need to decide whether or not you’re leaving.
I…
Don’t decide yet,
Will Daedalus even help us?
It isn’t easy being a brilliant inventor,
I’ll—I’ll try.
He has ordered you to return,
Well, not ordered. He gave me a choice.
I promised I would not offer.
Offer what?
For you to stay.
Stay,
Like…forever?
You would be immortal on this island,
Just like that?
Just like that.
But…my friends.
What? What have I done to make you sad?
They send a person who can never stay,
Me?
If you could see your face.
Of course, you.
That’s why you’ve been pulling away all this time?
But…I’m just…I mean, I’m just me.
That is enough,
I can’t,
I would never do anything to hurt you,
Then come to the beach, my hero. And we will send you on your way.
This will take you wherever you desire,
Maybe I can visit you,
But—
Go, please.
I promise.
Camp Half-Blood,
Sail me home.
—assume he is dead,
He’s right there!
Percy!
Well,
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?
I—we thought you were dead, Seaweed Brain!
I’m sorry,
I got lost.
LOST?
Two weeks, Percy? Where in the world—
Annabeth,
You’ve been gone two weeks.
When I heard the explosion, I thought—
I know,
He told you the answer?
Percy, that’s crazy!
But this is my quest,
I need to lead it.
And this is supposed to help? Please! It’s wrong. It’s cowardly. It’s—
Hard to admit we need a mortal’s help,
But it’s true.
She will calm down,
She’s jealous, my boy.
That’s stupid. She’s not…it’s not like…
We won’t dwell on your choices,
Tell that to Annabeth.
Chiron,
what about Grover and Tyson? Do you think—
I don’t know, my boy.
Grover and Tyson are very resourceful, however. We can still hope.
I shouldn’t have let them run off.
I suppose. The empathy link. But—
There is something else I should tell you, Percy,
Great.
Chris Rodriguez, our guest…
Is he dead?
Not yet,
I’m sorry to say,
Disappeared? How?
He’s a spy for Luke.
It can’t be a coincidence.
What about Mrs. O’Leary?
Quintus wouldn’t just leave her.
Whoa!
Whoa, girl!
Can’t breathe. Lemme up!
Where’s your master?
You’re lucky she didn’t bite your head off.
Came here to practice yesterday,
She’s an intelligent dog,
Funny.
Stupid hellhound,
I heard about Chris,
I’m sorry.
Yeah, well. Sometimes things go wrong.
Chris was brave,
I hope he gets better.
Do me a favor,
Yeah, sure.
Clarisse—
Practice time is over. From now on, it’s for real.
Minos, King of Crete!
That is not your concern.
Father,
Ingenious man,
Oh, indeed. My daughters’ tutor. They are quite fond of him.
I would be careful of that.
Yes,
He is a thief,
I offer you a choice,
Father,
you can’t—
Silence, Aelia.
The gods do not love those who harbor criminals, either.
Very well. You shall have your man in chains.
Father!
This way, Your Majesty,
Ahh.
You have been chasing your prey ten years, my lord?
You must be very determined.
I never forget a debt.
Oh, indeed, my lord!
You know, my lord,
Daedalus spoke to you about me?
Yes, my lord.
He is a genius,
What do you want?
Why do you do this?
You tell Daedalus,
Brave words, Your Majesty,
A painless death,
Yes,
I fear I have brought you trouble.
Somewhere safe,
Then where will you go?
A place I swore never to enter again,
I do not understand,
It’s best you did not.
But what of the Underworld?
Perhaps,
Find me if you dare, king of the ghosts.
You never told us of secret passages!
You have been busy.
The Labyrinth has been busy,
It should’ve been the last turn.
Sir!
Maps are useless here,
Don’t worry. I’ll find it.
Sir, is it true that the larger the group—
But how will we get the thread?
Sir!
The dracaenae found a half-blood!
Alone? Wandering the maze?
Who is it?
No one I’ve ever seen before, sir.
A blessing from Kronos. We may be able to use this halfblood. Come!
An Iris-message from Eurytion.
Eurytion! Is something wrong with Nico?
He left the ranch last night, heading back into the maze.
He’s in danger,
That’s not what I meant,
I had this dream last night…
That’s very, very bad.
So what do we do?
I told them you were all right,
So,
Yep,
That pretty much covers it.
I wish Paul were here,
Oh, right. The school.
What did you tell him?
I’ll talk to him,
You would do that?
Well, yeah. I mean, he’ll think we’re crazy.
He already thinks that.
Then there’s nothing to lose.
Thank you, Percy. I’ll tell him you’ll be home…
Percy has this plan.
It sounds very dangerous. But it might work.
You have the same abilities, don’t you?
We’ll try, Ms. Jackson,
I see,
Well, remember,
Grover and Tyson are counting on you two.
I know,
Maybe if we push her over,
Hey, Percy.
Good timing! Let’s get some coffee.
So,
it’s Annabell, right?
Annabeth,
Do you always dress in gold?
Not usually,
Shhh!
Okay.
That’s not funny,
This isn’t a joke, mortal girl.
Hold it, you two,
Just calm down.
I’m calm,
Look,
Nah. They asked me a lot of questions about you. I played dumb.
Was it hard?
Okay, stop!
You need my help?
Yeah,
Maybe.
So you want me to guide you,
You can see through the Mist,
And if you’re wrong?
I could die?
Yeah.
Yeah,
Nice guy,
He’s under the influence of a Titan,
Okay,
I’m in.
Are you sure?
We have to find an entrance to the Labyrinth,
Okay. What does an entrance to the Labyrinth look like?
It could be anything,
Like this?
That’s it,
You know Greek?
No,
Why?
It hasn’t been used in a long time,
I tried to open it once,
No.
It just needs the touch of a half-blood.
Wow.
So…after you?
You’re the guide,
Lead on.
A Cyclops,
It’s very old. It’s not…anybody we know.
You have a friend who’s a Cyclops?
Tyson,
My half brother.
Your half brother.
Hopefully we’ll find him down here,
And Grover. He’s a satyr.
Oh.
Well then, we’d better keep moving.
That looks like the tunnel Tyson and Grover took.
We need to go straight,
That’s the least likely choice,
You don’t see it?
Look at the floor.
There’s a brightness there,
You believe her?
Yeah,
Don’t you?
No traps?
Nothing.
Should it be this easy?
I don’t know,
It never was before.
So, Rachel,
where are you from, exactly?
Brooklyn,
Aren’t your parents going to be worried if you’re out late?
Why not?
What was that?
I don’t know,
Metal hinges.
Oh, that’s very helpful. I mean, what is it?
Run?
Run,
Well, well,
Taking your little mortal pet for a walk?
Can I eat them?
No,
Oh, yessssss,
Who’s your host?
My what?
You stay here.
Hey!
I’m sorry. I’ll get you out of this.
Luke,
Help!
DEATH! DEATH!
Please! No!
Good entertainment!
Lord Antaeus,
A favor I have not yet granted,
If his death pleases you,
Perhaps!
perhaps.
Luke!
Stop this. Let us go!
Annabeth?
Enough time for the females to fight afterward,
First, Percy Jackson, what weapons will you choose?
How can you be a son of Poseidon?
I am his favorite son!
Percy!
His mother is Gaea! Gae—
You’re crazy, Antaeus,
Weapons,
Just my sword,
Round one!
No!
Nice job, Percy.
Round two!
Who are you?
Ethan Nakamura,
I have to kill you.
Why are you doing this?
Hey!
Stop talking and fight already!
I have to prove myself,
Only way to join up.
Blood!
Boo!
Stand and fight!
Get it over with,
Forget it.
Don’t be a fool,
They’ll just kill us both.
No one dishonors the games!
When you see your chance, run.
I am the greatest wrestler in the world, boy,
Pankration?
He means fighting to the death,
Thanks for the tip,
Don’t mention it.
This shouldn’t take long. I swear to your terms!
Good luck,
You’ll need it.
Weapons?
I’ll stick with my sword. You?
With pleasure.
Argggh!
Now you see why I never lose, demigod!
Puny boy,
Not a worthy son of the sea god!
HEY!
Come down here, coward!
WAAA!
Get me down!
Free him!
He is our host!
I’ll free him.
Jackson!
I should have killed you long ago!
You tired,
Spare the girl.
I would speak to her before—before our great triumph.
What was that supposed to do?
AROOOOF
Let’s go!
Heel, Mrs. O’Leary!
The far exit!
That’s the right way!
This way!
Why should we follow you?
It was the way you needed to go,
Duck!
You people are crazy.
Yeah, and you’re Annabeth. I remember.
What—what happened to your eye?
You must be the half-blood from my dream,
Who’s Nico?
Never mind,
Gee, I wonder.
We’re going after Daedalus,
You really are crazy if you think Daedalus will help you.
He has to,
We’ll make him listen.
Yeah, well. Good luck with that.
Something was wrong with Luke,
Did you notice the way he was acting?
He looked pretty pleased to me,
You’re impossible,
So which way now, Sacagawea?
We’ll follow the path,
The brightness on the floor.
The brightness that led us straight into a trap?
Lay off her, Annabeth,
She’s doing the best she can.
Annabeth’s usually not like this,
Are you sure you don’t know?
What do you mean?
Boys,
Totally blind.
No, you were right,
Hey, I’m usually about to die,
Don’t feel bad.
I paint. I read a lot.
What about your family?
Oh…they’re just, you know, family.
You said they wouldn’t notice if you were gone.
Oh, sure. Sorry if…
I’ll take first watch,
You should sleep, too.
You don’t have to act like that.
Like what?
Like…never mind.
So close to your own destruction, little hero,
And still you are blind.
I have much to thank you for,
You have assured my rise.
A favor,
Hurry!
It’s going to eat you!
How do you know?
It just told me! Run!
No!
Percy, wake up!
Tyson—Tyson’s in trouble!
We have to help him!
First things first,
Earthquake!
Rachel!
You know what?
I like this way after all.
There,
This way,
We’re close!
This is so wrong!
We’re here,
Daedalus’s workshop.
So much for ancient architecture,
Di immortals,
He’s a genius. Look at the curves on this building!
And an artist,
These wings are amazing!
Where are we?
Colorado Springs,
The Garden of the Gods.
You,
What have you done with Daedalus?
Trust me, my dear. You don’t want to meet him.
Look, Mr. Traitor,
You think I’m an agent of Kronos,
That I work for Luke.
Well, duh,
You’re an intelligent girl,
Luke mentioned you,
Of course,
I’ve been almost everywhere. Even here.
The view changes from day to day,
You’ve been here before,
Oh, yes.
That’s an illusion out there?
A projection or something?
No,
It’s real. We’re really in Colorado.
Enough games,
What have you done with Daedalus?
I knew that
LIAR!
Yeah right, and I’m Zeus.
I am both,
That’s true,
You see?
A girl of many talents.
But you don’t even look like Daedalus,
Yes,
You’ve finally guessed the truth.
You’re an automaton. You made yourself a new body.
Percy,
Do you know what Quintus means, my dear?
The fifth, in Latin. But—
This is my fifth body.
That’s amazing!
That’s weird,
You found a way to transfer your animus into a machine?
That’s…not natural.
A murderer’s brand,
For your nephew, Perdix,
I did not push him. I simply—
Made him lose his balance,
Let him die.
You really are Daedalus,
So you have talked to Luke.
Oh, yes. Several times. He is quite persuasive.
But now you’ve seen the camp!
Privacy from what?
The gods,
But how can you hide from Hades?
They do not know everything,
You mean Minos,
And you did,
for two thousand years.
There is my old friend!
My only companion all these long lonely years.
You let her save me,
That whistle actually worked.
Guilty about what?
That your quest would be in vain.
What?
Where is it?
With Luke,
Kronos promised me freedom,
That’s your brilliant idea?
That’s not true!
Someone’s coming!
There you are, my old friend.
Luke sends his compliments,
This was not part of our agreement,
No indeed,
Treachery.
Get used to it,
Nico,
Are you okay?
You were trying to help us?
I was tricked,
He tricked all of us.
Where’s Luke? Why isn’t he here?
Percy,
the wings. Do you think—
Get them,
I’ll try to buy you some time.
Kill the inventor! Kill him!
To me!
Spirits of the dead!
No!
You do not control me, young fool,
I am the son of Hades,
Be gone!
No.
I am.
Never!
I will not—
You will taste wonderful!
No…school…spirit…
We have to help Daedalus!
No time,
Too many coming!
Now you!
Daedalus!
Come on!
I won’t leave Mrs. O’Leary!
Go!
None of us know how to fly!
Great time to find out,
Yeah!
Land!
These wings won’t last forever.
How long?
I don’t want to find out!
The workshop moved,
There’s no telling where.
So what do we do now?
How do we get back in the maze?
No,
He isn’t dead.
How can you be sure?
I know when people die. It’s this feeling I get, like a buzzing in my ears.
What about Tyson and Grover, then?
We have to get into town,
We could just take a plane,
I don’t fly.
But you just did.
That was low flying,
So we need a car to take us into the city,
I’ll take care of it.
How?
Just trust me.
I’ll go with you,
I’m hungry.
I’ll stick with Rachel, then,
Meet you guys in the parking lot.
What are you going to do?
Just wait here,
Please.
I talked to Chiron,
The driver’s ready when we are,
Come on,
Where to, Miss Dare?
I’m not sure yet, Robert,
Whatever you say, miss.
Do you know this guy?
No.
But he dropped everything to help you. Why?
Just keep your eyes peeled,
Help me look.
Get off the highway!
Miss?
I saw something, I think. Get off here.
What did you see?
Western Museum of Mining & Industry.
There.
An old mine entrance.
A door to the Labyrinth?
How can you be sure?
Well, look at it!
I mean…I can see it, okay?
No!
No, really. Thanks, Robert. But we’re fine.
Have you seen this one,
Thanks for coming after us,
That’s what you were after all along,
You could be accepted,
You could have friends at camp.
Do you really believe that, Percy?
What is it?
Is it that way?
No,
Not at all.
Why are we stopping then?
Listen,
Eucalyptus trees,
Like in California.
There’s something evil down that tunnel,
And the smell of death,
Luke’s entrance,
I have to check it out,
Percy, no.
Luke could be right here,
Then we’ll all go.
No,
Percy, don’t,
Don’t go up there alone.
I’ll be quick,
I won’t do anything stupid.
Thanks.
Here goes nothing.
At least we salvaged the blade,
Yes! Yes!
Rewards beyond measure!
No, half-blood!
Gee, thanks,
Careful, fool,
Maybe I’ll let you unwrap it, then.
There!
We must sanctify it in blood,
What has happened!
Careful!
My lord,
Your symbol of power is remade.
You fool,
Whoa, what do you mean, he requires me?
Don’t be a coward!
No!
Ethan, don’t!
Trespasser!
Ethan,
don’t listen to them. Help me destroy it.
This body has been well prepared.
Don’t you think so, Percy Jackson?
Luke feared you,
Ah…much better,
What have you done to Luke?
Run, little hero,
Run!
PERCY!
Ow!
Luke?
What—
AFTER THEM!
No!
I can’t go any farther,
That sucked,
You saved our lives,
Nice that they trust me so much,
Nico…you, uh, kind of gave yourself away.
What do you mean?
Big deal.
No,
That can’t be true. He couldn’t—
He gave himself over to Kronos,
No!
You saw when Rachel hit him.
It was the only thing I had.
But you saw,
So maybe Kronos wasn’t completely settled in the body, or whatever,
It doesn’t mean Luke was in control.
You want him to be evil, is that it?
What is it with you?
Why do you keep defending him?
Whoa, you two,
Knock it off!
We have to keep moving,
He’ll send monsters after us.
You did good back there,
Yeah, well. I didn’t want you to die.
Hey, I’m sorry. We need to move.
I know,
I’m…I’m all right.
Back to New York,
Rachel, can you—
We have to follow them,
What about Camp Half-Blood?
There’s no time.
We have to find them,
They’re our friends.
Tyson!
Percy! Come quick!
What happened?
So many things,
Did he say anything?
He said, ‘We’re close.’ Then hit his head on rocks.
Grover,
Wake up.
Uhhhhhhhh.
Splurg!
Percy? Annabeth? Where…
It’s okay,
You passed out. The presence was too much for you.
I—I remember. Pan.
Yeah,
Something powerful is just beyond that doorway.
Anyway,
Come on, Grover. Lean on me.
I think we’re in Carlsbad Caverns,
Maybe an unexplored section.
How do you know?
Carlsbad is in New Mexico,
That would explain last winter.
Oh, wow.
Lord Pan!
I…got lost,
It’s a Small World.
You have a humming dodo bird,
Yes, that’s Dede. My little actress.
This is the most beautiful place!
I am glad you like it, dear,
My lord,
Chose?
I—I don’t understand.
I have slept many eons,
What?
But no! You’re right here!
My dear satyr,
But that wasn’t true!
Your kind never believed it,
No!
Dear Grover,
But gods can’t die,
They can fade,
Dede, what are you doing?
But…no!
Be strong,
Percy Jackson,
I know you believe you cannot make amends,
I—
I know you don’t believe this now,
My dear satyr,
will you carry my message?
I—I can’t.
You can,
I don’t want to.
I know,
Thank you, dear satyr. My final blessing.
Are…are you okay?
We should go now,
and tell them. The great god Pan is dead.
They’re beautiful!
Yeah,
Well,
I guess this is it.
Thanks, Rachel,
We couldn’t have done it without you.
I wouldn’t have missed it. I mean, except for almost dying, and Pan…
He said something about your father,
You mean…you’re rich?
Well, yeah.
Yes,
Hey, you can’t blame yourself for that.
No,
Uh, yeah. Sure.
I mean…I’d like that,
My number’s not in the book,
I’ve got it.
Still on your hand? No way.
No. I kinda…memorized it.
Go without me!
Nico,
we need your help.
Nico,
Please.
All right,
I feared as much,
Wait a moment,
What?
It’s true,
We were there when he died. All of us.
Impossible! You are all liars! Nature-destroyers!
We will speak of this later.
We will speak of it now!
We must deal with this—
Silenus,
Stay with me, Percy,
I saw Kronos,
How could he take over a mortal body?
Kronos said his body had been prepared.
Chiron, if he leads the attack—
Lock shields!
Fire!
GO!
Nico!
Serve me,
Hey!
Percy!
Thanks, Percy!
No problem!
Di Immortales!
This might be it,
Could be.
Nice fighting with you, Seaweed Brain.
Ditto.
Come on!
We need help!
Now!
Good girl!
Briares!
Hail, little brother!
Stand firm!
No!
Are you all right?
How embarrassing,
You need help,
I’ll get a medic from Apollo’s cabin.
No,
That was amazing,
I don’t know where it came from.
I do!
Percy, come quick! It is Nico!
Get some nectar!
Nico, what happened?
Can you talk?
Daedalus,
Yes, my boy,
I found the Hundred-Handed One as I came through the maze,
Yay!
Briares! I knew you would come!
I did not know,
Yes, my young architect,
My work is here,
Small compensation for the way I have acted,
Whoa,
Pass on? But you can’t just kill yourself. That’s wrong.
You won’t get a fair trial,
I will take what comes,
Yes,
Will you take my soul for ransom, then?
No,
Well done, son of Hades. You are becoming wise.
Then I am ready to see my son…and Perdix,
Come on,
We have work to do.
It was panic,
Panic?
Percy,
Preposterous!
That wasn’t it, sir,
A vote!
I would,
Miss me?
Well, I did not miss this place!
Strike that,
But, my lord,
It’s just nonsense!
Yes, sire!
We must exile the traitor!
I say no,
That is my vote.
I vote no as well,
All in favor of the exile?
Three to two,
Ah, yes,
Then let it be dissolved!
I don’t care.
Don’t worry,
Well,
Grover seems to be growing up.
Go left at the reef,
You’re giving him directions to the forges?
I want to see Cyclopes,
I doubt you’ll be lonely down there,
You helped him a lot.
I only talked to him.
He throws good rocks!
Saying good-bye,
We missed you at dinner,
You could’ve sat with me.
No.
I’m not staying, Percy.
But…you can’t just leave. It’s too dangerous out there for a lone halfblood. You need to train.
I train with the dead,
When will you go?
Makes sense,
But I hope we don’t have to be enemies.
By the way…
I don’t play that game anymore. It’s for kids.
It’s got four thousand attack power,
Five thousand,
Maybe it’s okay to still be a kid once in a while.
Thanks.
I’ve got a lot of things to investigate,
Keep in touch, Nico.
There goes a very troubled young man.
Walk with me,
Where to?
Just to the campfire,
Uh, thanks.
We have had many betrayals,
It was a group effort.
You cured him?
Madness is my specialty. It was quite simple.
But…you did something nice. Why?
Uh—
Why are you telling me this?
There’s a private school out there that I’ll be going to,
Yeah, well, call me, okay?
Sure,
I’ll keep my eyes open for…
Annabeth,
What was the rest of the prophecy?
You shall delve in the darkness of the endless maze,
You shall rise or fall by the ghost king’s hand,
Percy—
And lose a love to worse than death.
That was the last line, Percy. Are you happy now?
Oh,
You have nothing to apologize for, my dear.
Hera,
A success?
Our family is safe,
Oh, please.
Hephaestus was right,
Percy is right.
You will regret this insult, Annabeth. You will regret this very much.
I’m sorry,
I—I should get back. I’ll keep in touch.
Listen, Annabeth—
You’d better get going,
Take care, Seaweed Brain.
Yeah. It’s cool. I can’t wait.
You’ve had a rough summer,
How do you know that? Did my mom—
I mean, not close friends, but still—
I’m sorry.
Yeah. And, uh, I guess the girl stuff…
Here.
Percy, I kind of feel bad giving you one more thing to think about,
But I wanted to ask you something.
Yeah?
Girl stuff.
What do you mean?
Your mom,
I’m thinking about proposing to her.
You mean…marrying her? You and her?
Well, that was the genera idea. Would that be okay with you?
You’re asking my permission?
Man to man,
I think that’s a great idea, Paul. Go for it.
Cheers, Percy. Let’s join the party.
Who could that be?
Pos—
Um, hello.
Hello, Sally,
Yes
Help.
Hi, I’m Paul Blofis.
Ah, no. Blofis, actually.
Oh, I see,
Poseidon? That’s an interesting name.
Yes, I like it. I’ve gone by other names, but I do prefer Poseidon.
Like the god of the sea.
Very much like that, yes.
Well!
Ah.
I see.
There you are, my boy. And Tyson, hello, son!
Daddy!
Tyson is…
Not mine,
It’s a long story.
I couldn’t miss Percy’s fifteenth birthday,
That’s true,
I used to teach ancient history.
Are you all right, my boy?
Yeah. I’m fine. I guess.
I heard stories,
So Kronos is indeed back. It will not be long before full war is upon us.
What about Luke?
Is he really gone?
I don’t know, Percy. It is most disturbing.
But his body is mortal. Couldn’t you just destroy him?
The old sea gods?
Let me come down there,
Let me help.
Your birthday present. Spend it wisely.
Uh, spend a sand dollar?
What situation?
When the time comes,
I think you’ll know.
Dad,
He dedicated them to me,
Percy? The candles are melting!
You’d better go,
The eruptions are continuing,
I’m sorry,
I didn’t mean—
Nice plant,
Sorry,
Didn’t mean to startle you.
That’s—that’s okay. I mean…what are you doing here?
I’ve done some exploring,
You saw him?
That’s good.
What?
The way to beat Luke,
Okay. I’m listening.
Come inside for some cake and ice cream,
